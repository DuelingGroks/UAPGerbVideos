Until recently, UFOs have been seen as anomalous craft operating in deep space near Earth orbit within Earth's atmosphere, and occasionally, whether purposefully or due to a mysterious crash touching our planet's surface. But a fascinating aspect of the trans medium capabilities of these craft has long been forgotten, until Commander David Fravor sighting of the Tic TAC, which seemingly communicated with something churning under the water surface.

Military footage showing UAP entering or leaving Earth's waters in the incredible efforts of Rear Admiral Timothy Gallaudet. What's up guys? It's UAP group and today I want to cover the history and some famous historical sightings of one of the most overlooked aspects of the phenomenon undersea UFOs or unidentified submerged objects. The idea UFOs are not only operating in our skies, but also the most unexplored regions of our planet, is both profound and somewhat disturbing.

00;01;00;03 - 00;01;06;23
Unknown
So let's not waste time. Let's get right into it.

00;01;06;26 - 00;01;42;28
Unknown
Shockingly, the study of Uso's is not a recent undertaking. In fact, we can head all the way back to the early days of Project Bluebook. In 1951, USAF Major Dewey Frenette, Bluebook member, undertook one project interloper, with the aid of the U.S. Navy. The goal of this project was to investigate both aerial and undersea UAP, regardless of serving as a sitting Bluebook member for Net's Operation, interloper was curiously an extra governmental investigation, meaning it was exempt from all Freedom of Information Act requests.

00;01;43;01 - 00;02;19;22
Unknown
Whether this was directed by USG elements or not, I'm not quite sure. However, in 1953, interloper briefed the CIA, but the project's findings never reached Congress or the American people. Today, only three case files remain from for Annette's project. Cases 26, 27 and 28. Case 26 covers US Navy Lieutenant George P Williams, who, alongside with his nine man crew and their Navy Fleet Logistics Air wing plane, observed a trans medium UFO depart the ocean and traversed the skies between Keflavik, Iceland and Newfoundland.

00;02;19;24 - 00;02;46;17
Unknown
The object, initially mistaken for a ship, rose from beneath the clouds and approached the Navy aircraft at a terrifying closing rate. The object hovered near the air wing's portside before disappearing at alarming speeds. The object was described as elliptical or cigar shaped, measuring a minimum of 200ft, with a red orange glow along the periphery. The other two surviving cases do not fit our investigation today, but still.

00;02;46;17 - 00;03;11;09
Unknown
Check this out. Case 27 highlights the experience of a South African Airways constellation craft and route from London to Johannesburg, near the Kenya border. The airplane crossed over the crater of a long extinct volcano, where the pilots noticed a silvery disc stationed deep within the crater. The disc took off at a high rate of speed straight up and out of sight of the craft.

00;03;11;12 - 00;03;45;26
Unknown
Next, we can look at the 24th of April, 1952 with the Air Force Technical Intelligence Center is written by AFO, AI and X SG regarding the possible connection of submarine contacts. This letter, addressed to one Colonel Dunn, attaches nine reports of submarine contacts with UFOs, specifically flying discs, with the assistance of Oni, the Office of Naval Intelligence. Unfortunately, these reports are unavailable, but what is interesting are the Navy UFO sightings listed in the 1950s.

00;03;45;28 - 00;04;19;26
Unknown
This information is relayed in Timothy Goode's book Need to Know UFOs the Military and Intelligence. Quotes information supplied by respected ufologist Leonard Stringfield, who I covered in the Kingman, Arizona crash. Stringfield was informed of thousands of ona UAP reports from 1952 to 1956, but I skipped over this mysterious sender of the nine reports FOIA in XD. Afolayan is the Air Force Office of Intelligence, and we can assume that this SG is a special group.

00;04;19;28 - 00;04;47;09
Unknown
Curiously, we can look back to Edward J. Ruppert, a man I've talked about extensively who served as director of Project Grudge and Blue Book Report, stated that Afolayan was conducting a more complete investigation of UFOs parallel to Blue Book and the later uncovered Beatles project. Stork report stated FOIA and technical Capabilities Branch and Collection Control Branch were specific officers doing UFO related work.

00;04;47;12 - 00;05;12;17
Unknown
Was this Air Force Special group tasked with investigating the nine USO reports one of the US government's real secret UFO investigation groups? To me, it appears likely. In 1979 questioned the computer UFO network filed FOI a request for information on the mysterious special group. All requests were denied under executive order, citing the national security need to maintain classification.

00;05;12;19 - 00;05;49;16
Unknown
The trail here in the 1950s goes much deeper as well. In 1954, Jana, the joint Army, Navy, Air Force publication, published directive 146 C were both airborne and waterborne. UFO were to be reported under service communication instructions for reporting vital intelligence sightings and merit. I'm guessing this means maritime intelligence. This meant both civilians and pilots were prohibited from discussing officially reported sightings, as service and merit sightings were subject to the Communications Act of 1934 and espionage laws.

00;05;49;19 - 00;06;28;03

Violators would receive a prison sentence and a $10,000 fine. And if you've watched a single one of my videos, you probably know I talk often about USAF regulation 202, so I expect everybody knows that by heart. But if you don't, this regulation restricted all official UFO reporting to be sent to Atic and not Bluebook. Well, in that same year, 1954, January 23rd to be precise, the US Navy issued op nav the office of the Chief of Naval Operations Directive 3820, which required UAP sightings referenced as flying object reports to be sent to the director of Atic.

00;06;28;10 - 00;06;57;12
Unknown
The director of USAF intelligence, and the Director of Naval Intelligence. This report, which we can find a copy of in Donald Quixote's book The Flying Saucer Conspiracy, directly cites Jan op 146 C with the implementation of 1953 USAF regulation 200 Dash two up, Nav directive 3820 and Jan App 146 C we enter the slow descent into the dark ages of UFO reporting, starting with explanations of swamp gas and weather balloons.

00;06;57;14 - 00;07;09;14

So our paper trail here becomes relatively sparse, and we have to start to rely on claims of USO studies and experiences.

00;07;09;16 - 00;07;43;01
Unknown
We must travel all the way to 1985, where ufologist Jock Belay claims in Forbidden Science. Pacific Heights, a collection of his personal journals that a source at Nar cap, the National Aviation Reporting Center on Anomalous Phenomena, told him that a large collection of UFO and USO files were being stored at Norton Air Force Base. Norton has historically been associated with UAP or NHC research, such as being named by Steven Greer and the Disclosure Project in his alleged briefing to Congress in 1996.

00;07;43;03 - 00;08;06;26
Unknown
But let's move on to a really curious rabbit hole. From 2017. Of course, with an absence of official documentation, this story should be taken with some skepticism. But let's tackle the claims by astronomer Mark Dantonio. Dantonio, president of FCS models, a company with naval contracts, was taken for a ride in a naval submarine as a thank you for his company's contract work.

00;08;06;28 - 00;08;30;27
Unknown
While under sea, this sonar team picked up what they called a fast mover, traveling at several hundred knots. For reference, most submarines and torpedoes travel at roughly 40 knots. The commanding officer told the sonar operator to, quote, lock it and dog it, end quote, essentially burying the encounter. And years later, Mark asked a senior naval figure about the fast mover program.

00;08;31;00 - 00;08;51;22
Unknown
I bet you can all guess the response. Sorry, Mark, I can't talk about that program. This to Dantonio essentially confirmed the program's existence, especially since the figure told Mark that uso's were common and that there was a program in place to classify and log and determine the speed of them. But those reports go into a vault. Of course.

00;08;51;22 - 00;09;11;15
Unknown
Remember, this is all just a legit testimony. We have no way to prove this right now, but the year of 2022 is where chatter around USO became much louder and really made its way into the public. Zeit Geist. I'd like to take a look at the published notes of Oak Shannon, a figure I haven't mentioned since the Wilson Davis Memo video.

00;09;11;17 - 00;09;41;02
Unknown
Shannon, former manager of special projects at Lewis Alamos National Laboratories and Department of Energy nuclear physicist, confirmed the authenticity of the Wilson Davis memo. But that's not our focus for today. These notes, published in 2022, recall Oakes time at the Advanced Theoretical Working Group, held at BDM International's McLean Secure Facility and classified using Doc controls in 1985. These notes contain some fascinating information and I highly recommend reading them.

00;09;41;04 - 00;10;22;07
Unknown
You already know, just check the show notes. But alongside mention of some UFO hotspots such as Mount Hayes, Alaska, Shannon jots down the Navy, has intelligence on an underwater UFO hotspot near Golfo San Maties off the coast of Argentina. And we can also look at SSC. CIA operative John Ramirez, the man who made the Galactic Federation's claims famous, who in 2022 claimed he had heard rumors of a relationship between the Office of Naval Research and the CIA Office of Scientific and Weapons Research, slash wind PAC, the weapons, intelligence, nonproliferation and Arms Control Center where USO materials are recovered and transferred to the CIA.

00;10;22;09 - 00;10;34;18
Unknown
Interesting connections here, seen as there are some insane CIA UAP rabbit holes, but I want to save this for a more focused video on the topic.

00;10;34;21 - 00;11;05;17
Unknown
And now we get to absolutely the most credible figure to speak on USO, who featured on Sol's November 2023 panel. Timothy Gallaudet, retired U.S. Navy rear admiral, former Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere within the US Department of Commerce, and former administrator of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Here I am an ocean scientist for three and a half decades, and I sit in a lot of meetings with leading ocean scientists still today.

00;11;05;20 - 00;11;32;12
Unknown
But it just it kind of mystifies me that more people are intellectually curious about what the story of the century is, and that's these, these that are occurring in the water. On a fascinating News Nation interview with Ross Cole, Art Gallaudet has made some profound statements, such as we're being visited by non-human intelligence, with technology we really don't understand, and with intentions we don't understand at all either.

00;11;32;13 - 00;12;10;21
Unknown
Now, that really does surprise me to hear that from a former, very high ranking flag officer in the US Navy, to actually say, you're stating categorically that you believe in high non-human intelligence are real. Absolutely. I think it's about time that we do disclose that we we are in contact with non-human intelligence. There is so much of interest I want to cover on the rear admiral, such as his sole foundation discussion surrounding viewing the gimbal and go fast videos, but having them mysteriously removed from his inbox, or how, in his recent tweet, Gallaudet comments on the So Cal anomaly, possibly USO related, being scrubbed from Google Earth.

00;12;10;21 - 00;12;36;15
Unknown
But let's focus now on his 2024 sole published white paper. Beneath the Surface. We may learn more about UAP by looking in the ocean. This excellent paper was written by Gallaudet, and besides highlighting the obvious threat to maritime security, the paper frames the importance of USO study as an unprecedented opportunity for maritime science, and the subject should be elevated to national research priorities.

00;12;36;18 - 00;13;06;13
Unknown
Gallaudet calls for action to uncover the unknown unknowns associated with UAP and Uso's. Due to the concerning non reaction of the DoD regarding unidentified objects with unexplainable characteristics entering U.S. water space. In the executive summary of the piece, the Rear Admiral makes a beautiful statement. Quote. Yet, however, concerning the security implications of UAP are the scientific ramifications are nothing short of world changing.

00;13;06;15 - 00;13;35;28
Unknown
Pilots, credible observers, and calibrated military instrumentation have recorded objects accelerating at rates and crossing the air sea interface in ways not possible for anything made by humans, and several pieces of congressional legislation support these observations by defining UAP as trans medium vehicles. The stunning implication is that engineering, material science, and physics beyond the state of the art are needed to produce and operate these objects.

00;13;36;00 - 00;14;11;24
Unknown
This knowledge could transform such fields as air and maritime transportation, energy generation, agriculture, communication, computing, manufacturing and space travel. Virtually every imaginable economic sector, not to mention defense. Further study of UAP may lead to discoveries that make those of the scientific revolution in the 17th and 18th centuries look like baby steps. Throughout this paper, Gallaudet draws attention to the massive disparity between investigating UAP operating in our skies and UAP operating within our oceans.

00;14;11;26 - 00;14;45;06
Unknown
This is especially highlighted in the abysmal Aero historical Report volume one, which makes a grand total of zero references to any cases or whistleblowers having to do with USO or maritime situations. As I mentioned in the opening statement of this video, and this is really cool to see, Gallaudet mentioned the tic tac case, as observed in 2004 by the Navy FAA, ATF, Super Hornets, where the pilots observed the UAP hovering just above roiling ocean whitewater, possibly indicating a larger UAP below the surface.

00;14;45;08 - 00;15;16;05
Unknown
Other cases highlighted in this paper include the trans medium UAP, filmed in 2013, in Agua de Puerto Rico, captured by US customs and Border Protection thermal imaging systems. Quote over three minutes, the object appeared to fly at speeds between 40 and 120mph. Enter and exit the Atlantic Ocean without any significant deceleration, reach a maximum underwater velocity of 95mph, and at one point split into two parts before entering the water again.

00;15;16;08 - 00;15;42;26
Unknown
The Siu authorities concluded that no known aircraft, naval vessel, projectile or human made technology possesses these characteristics or capabilities. Gallaudet also draws from a body of literature to state that USO and trans medium UAP are just as diverse as those spotted traversing the skies. Quote luminous orbs, silver and gray discs, and triangular and cigar shaped objects with various lighting conditions.

00;15;42;28 - 00;16;16;18
Unknown
Large lighted craft are often seen under the sea surface without ever emerging, unquote. The paper also touches on a fascinating case I have never heard of that occurred off the coast of Shelburne Harbor, Nova Scotia, in 1960. And no, this isn't shag Harbor in 1967. However, the two are located extremely close. This case covers the encounters of several Royal Canadian Navy divers who participated in a U.S. Canadian joint minesweeper, an exercise where the divers claim to have observed two disc shaped craft on the seabed.

00;16;16;21 - 00;16;43;25
Unknown
Not only did the divers say they observed occupants attempting to repair one of the craft, but also recorded footage of the event. Wisely, Gallaudet thought this story pretty nonsensical or unbelievable until recent U.S. military whistleblower revelations. I really recommend reading this whole paper. Just check the show notes, the Rear Admiral wrote an excellent piece that deserves attention.

00;16;43;27 - 00;17;05;07
Unknown
After covering the sole paper, I would like to discuss just a handful of fascinating military USO cases that have caught my eye throughout history. In the same year of 2022. Lou Elizondo discussed a fascinating military USO encounter while being interviewed by astronaut Terry Virts. Check this out. I tell you, man, some of this stuff was was absolutely riveting.

00;17;05;12 - 00;17;32;15
Unknown
One of the other stories. Let's talk about the stuff. Yeah. Okay. Well, you know, I'll share with you, one one interesting. Event that occurred. It's it's pretty incredible. You have, I'm not going to go into too much detail. I want people to know who it is. I, you know, the person is kind of very cagey about this, but, you have a helicopter going out of, a Caribbean island on a on a regular basis because the Navy likes to test fire.

00;17;32;22 - 00;17;50;24
Unknown
Some of its cruise missile technology and whatnot. And what will happen is that that after the cruise missile runs out of fuel, that kind of falls into the splashes into the ocean, it will sink. And then at a certain time, we kind of it kind of rises up. We go and fetch it. And we, we analyze it for telemetry and things like that.

00;17;50;27 - 00;18;14;05
Unknown
Long story short, helicopter crew goes out. To, to recover one of these things, as they are recovering it. The first time the missile, they're pulling up and something what was described round and circular, about the size of a small island. Black dark color starts rising to the surface. It doesn't break the water, but it starts rising to the surface.

00;18;14;05 - 00;18;32;25
Unknown
And they thought, wow, that's really, really peculiar. Well, the next month goes around and they go out to retrieve this, this this another missile that was test fired. And this time we've got a frogman hanging down from the roof about to to latch on to the to the missile. And, this thing starts coming out of the water again.

00;18;32;26 - 00;18;51;17
Unknown
And if you know about the Puerto Rican trench out there, you're talking about water. That's 22,000ft deep. It's. Yeah, it's the second deepest part of the ocean. The thing starts rising up and and that's the thing is starting to come to the surface. The frogman is literally trying to climb the rope. They're doing an emergency ascent. Everybody is absolutely panic!

00;18;51;17 - 00;19;21;02
Unknown
At the disco, freaking out. You know, what the hell is that? What's going on? And as they start to pull up, it sucks the missile underwater and then disappears, never to be seen again. And David Fravor TikTok encounter isn't the only time the US Navy and military has encountered these in 2010. USN Petty Officer John Baumann saw a tic tac shaped object from the flight deck of the USS Carl Vinson off the coast of Haiti.

00;19;21;04 - 00;19;44;08
Unknown
Quote I was staring into the water from above when a large, fat, white Tic TAC object, approximately 20ft in length, suddenly appeared, in my view, below me, moving right, and darted into the depths as fast as it appeared. I couldn't really comprehend what I saw. It was definitely a solid object, but when it descended, it's forward and rapidly collapsed in on itself and disappeared.

00;19;44;08 - 00;20;15;16
Unknown
End quote. Bauman reported this sighting to his supervising officer, but was not debriefed and not to file a report. The officer told him that everybody sees weird things in the ocean. Everybody knows the famous Tic TAC sighting scene from the USS Nimitz in 2004. But did you know in 1991 the same vessel had a USO encounter? Petty Officer Kevin Thomas claimed to have seen a huge black triangle, end quote, near one kilometer in length, lift out of the ocean and shoot vertically into the sky.

00;20;15;19 - 00;20;39;00
Unknown
When he was left on deck after the ship was ordered to darken and cleared decks, Thomas claimed to have witnessed no water dripping off the craft nor sound made by the craft. The next day, men in civilian clothes appeared and interviewed Thomas on board the Nimitz, asking why he was outside and what he saw. Thomas said not a peep due to fear of being disciplined.

00;20;39;03 - 00;21;00;07
Unknown
This story needs to be approached with some skepticism because full transparency at the moment, I am unable to uncover Thomas a service record, and here I just wanted to cover a handful of these USO cases. If for my next video you guys would like to see me tackle solely a list of USO cases officially reported throughout Bluebook in other channels, let me know.

00;21;00;10 - 00;21;09;02
Unknown
I personally really want to make that video, so if the interest is there, I will absolutely tackle it.

00;21;09;05 - 00;21;36;17
Unknown
And lastly, guys, I just wanted to cover a series of very controversial images taken in March of 1971 from the USS tripping. These images purport to show the vessel's encounter with at least two forms of UAP slash uso's a triangle and cigar shaped craft. Debate has circled endlessly since these photos first appeared, some arguing they are legitimate, some arguing they're hoaxes, and some arguing the images are real.

00;21;36;17 - 00;22;10;15
Unknown
But depicting engagement with test barrage balloons. And I do have to add, there are some people who think all or some of these photos are an example of Theta Morgana, a complex mirage appearing above the horizon. The story goes. These images first appeared in a French magazine called Top Secret. The original scans of the images were sent to investigator Alex Streeter, allegedly, the tripping station between Iceland and Jan Mayen Island in March of 1971, led by Admiral Dean Reynolds Sackett, happened upon the Uso's by accident.

00;22;10;17 - 00;22;38;00
Unknown
Officer John Clicker initially spotted the objects with the onboard periscope. Some of these images seem to be harmless snapshots of the objects hovering, entering, or leaving the water, while others appeared to show the objects in distress. Unknown if this was due to engagement with the tripping, well, we can actually confirm that the USS tripping was indeed in the Arctic at this time, especially near Bluenose Arctic Circle during November of 1971.

00;22;38;03 - 00;23;04;08
Unknown
And we can confirm this was the only vessel in the region. I cannot find any information on if attack submarines carry balloons for training exercises solely. This joint USN CIA document on testing balloon launches from submarines that was conducted in 1955. So this does cast doubt on the balloon training exercise theory for me, especially due to the fact there are no live fire records by the submarine at this time.

00;23;04;11 - 00;23;31;09
Unknown
Investigator and Navy pilot Steve Marino was able to speak to Admiral Sackett. Admiral Sackett was gracious enough to take multiple phone calls, but steered away from the UFO question. The admiral stated he did not see anything unusual onboard the tripping, nor did anyone else. He only saw ice. The alleged spotter from the periscope, John Clicker, whose identity we can also confirm, was also contacted.

00;23;31;12 - 00;23;54;16
Unknown
He stated he found the investigation interesting and did not know what the pictures represented. So these two statements essentially kill the training range story for me. We are left with likely a hoax or the real deal. But the Admiral and Clicker either cannot break security oaths or were unaware of these signatures. Unfortunately, one of the best images of the lot shows signs of tampering.

00;23;54;18 - 00;24;16;03
Unknown
Credit to Wim van Utrecht for this discovery. To my knowledge, this is the only such example of photo tampering. Though he is extremely skeptical on these images, I tend to agree with the thesis of John Greenwald here that this altered image does not discredit the validity of the other images. John states many publications will enhance photographs for print.

00;24;16;05 - 00;24;42;22
Unknown
This is done to improve visual appeal, and since the original images does indeed differ somewhat in aspect from the magazine image, I find this hypothesis to be pretty plausible. So are these images of the triangle cigar and possibly an egg shaped UAP interacting with our oceans real or a hoax? Personally I'm undecided. I need to do more investigation into this case, but the images are perplexing to say the least.

Hey guys, thank you so much for joining me today as we took this dive into the history and fascinating aspects of USO. In my opinion, throughout history, USO have been severely overlooked until 2022 and onward. Thank you. Timothy Gallaudet, one of the biggest inspirations for this video. I find that I've never, ever, ever, anywhere seen the history of USO study covered.

00;25;07;12 - 00;25;33;19
Unknown
Now, here at my channel and probably many other channels too, we go in-depth into Project Bluebook, the Robertson Panel, the Condon Report, all of these aspects throughout history of UFO being studied openly or secretly. But you never hear about USO. So I just really wanted to touch on this fascinating aspect of the phenomenon. And if you guys want, I really want to make that, kind of video on some famous or underrepresented USO cases.

00;25;33;19 - 00;25;52;14
