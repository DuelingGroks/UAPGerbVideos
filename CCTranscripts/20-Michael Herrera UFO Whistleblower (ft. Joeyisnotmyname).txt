Was something that stuck out so well. It's always going to be basically in prison in my mind for the rest of my life. And it has been for 14 years. You look down into into the Valley. Yep. And there's a clearing. There's a clearing with a UAP. Yes. Just sitting there. Sitting there, rotating clockwise. Yeah. And that's in transition.

00;00;18;18 - 00;00;38;17
Unknown
This color spectrum I was telling you to. So as far as from a distance, yes. That looks very accurate to what I saw. Rogue military force if you will. The most concerning thing about this is they all had American dialects. They had American gear, they had TVs black, they had black camouflage. They had very similar setups to what we have, but more high speed.

00;00;38;17 - 00;01;03;29
Unknown
Something what you would see special operation operation groups these days have they had no insignias on. And that's what I thought it was it, I thought they were going to smoke us, you know. And they kept saying that, you know, we can kill you right now, you know, as, as this is at the start of the year, I made a video titled The Marines Who Got Too Close to UFOs, where I talked about two whistleblower testimonies of men who encountered UAP throughout their military service in the USMC.

00;01;04;01 - 00;01;33;22
Unknown
And this included Jonathan Wiegand and, of course, Michael Herrera. And guys, I'll admit my biases. While I was really supportive of Jonathan Wigand and found his story to be credible, I was really dismissive of Herrera. Now for Michael Herrera, I'm torn on his story. I just I'm not sure about that. This all changed when Redditor and now my good friend Joey is not My name, reached out to me and asked if I was the creator of this video.

00;01;33;25 - 00;01;51;20
Unknown
Joey told me that he had been investigating Michael deeply, and that he and him had actually established a relationship and talked weekly. I even left a paper trail with certain people, including Joey is not My name, and there's been a person who has helped with that. Joey, that's not my name. You. If you're watching this, thank you for your help.

00;01;51;20 - 00;02;16;17
Unknown
As more of a person, you know, who has a broad attention to detail on a lot of things, which is remarkable is Reddit handle is Joey is not my name. And finally, he told me that he had enough evidence to attest to the fact that Michael met a man, an insider, in the black reverse engineering program. This brief exchange messages led to a fast friendship between Joey and myself.

00;02;16;20 - 00;02;51;25
Unknown
And for months, actually, he and I have been talking every day, messaging, video calls and phone calls discussing Michael's case. And throughout this time, he has shown me some of the astonishing evidence to both support Michael's claims of his experience in Indonesia and his experience meeting an insider in the black reverse engineering programs. So today, guys, I am thrilled to tell you that I actually have my good friend Joey is not my name on the show to talk about his experience investigating Herrera's case and discuss some of the evidence he's actually found to corroborate Michael.

00;02;51;27 - 00;03;18;07
Unknown
If you've never heard of Michael Herrera, I'd be shocked, especially after so much renewed interest in his encounter after being all but named in the abominable Nation. That is the Arrow Historical Report, volume one. But for those of you who don't know or may need a quick refresher, let's briefly summarize Michael's UFO whistleblower encounter. And guys, please note as I talk about Michael's testimony, I will be recounting it as fact, as told by Michael.

00;03;18;09 - 00;03;46;22
Unknown
The reality is, there is still no way we can prove with evidence that Michael encountered this UFO in the jungles of Indonesia. But we can prove with facts some of the context around Michael's story, such as the military mission in Indonesia and the relief effort by the USAF and Marines in the summer of 2023. Stephen Greer's National Press Club event featured an array of whistleblower individuals ranging from credible to somewhat dubious.

00;03;46;25 - 00;04;12;27
Unknown
One of these men was a USMC vet who seemed emboldened to break his 14 year silence, yet nervous to reveal himself to the public. It was here Michael Herrera first told his story to the world in 2009. Second Battalion, fifth Marine Michael Herrera, at this time a 20 year old Saul Gunner, was called into Indonesia for a human relief aid mission after the devastating Sumatra earthquake and tsunami.

00;04;13;00 - 00;04;54;02
Unknown
Michael was stationed on the USS Denver, which is, oddly enough, the name of both of our hometowns. This was the only ship routed to the west coast of Indonesia from the US seventh fleet. In October of 2009, Pereira's unit was informed they would be providing security to aid in the delivery of food and medical supplies, and it's crucial to note, although humanitarian missions generally do not see soldiers equipped with weapons, the first Marines reportedly were, and in this case M-16, a force due to the heavy presence of terrorist training in the area, Herrera's team arrived near Pan from 53 helos at a hasty LZ, where the team pushed to a high ground for reconnaissance purposes.

00;04;54;04 - 00;05;17;18
Unknown
And it's worth noting, and rightfully one of the biggest points of contention surrounding Michael's testimony. Herrera states his team was not equipped with radio comms, and Michael himself states this was highly abnormal. The team trekked up a ridge at an elevation of roughly 300m. Herrera had on him a Panasonic camera and was taking images of the surrounding area.

00;05;17;20 - 00;05;45;11
Unknown
Once the Marines reached the high point of the ridge, something stuck out like a sore thumb and quote against the jungle terrain. There was a craft rotating just above the tree line, transitioning colors between a light Matt gray and a dark matte black. Perplexed, the team decided to approach and investigate, and it's key to note Michael did in fact take pictures of the craft with the camera he stored in his spent magazine pouch.

00;05;45;14 - 00;06;24;06
Unknown
Reaching down the slope. The USMC team was about 150m from the craft. It was from here Michael estimated the craft to be 300ft in diameter. It was octagonal in shape, rotating clockwise with Vantablack exterior panels and a pyramid type shape on top. The craft let off an audible hum, almost like a guitar amp.

00;06;24;08 - 00;06;55;08
Unknown
The craft floated 15 to 20ft above the ground, surrounded by a, quote, rogue military force. What was astounding is these men featured a American dialect, American gear, and similar setups the Marines had, but with much better equipment. These men had no rank, no insignia. Eight of the men engaged the marines directing their weapons at the soldiers and flipping off the weapons safeties screaming at the Marines, asking what they were doing there and threatening their lives.

00;06;55;10 - 00;07;25;19
Unknown
Terrified, the Marines complied. They were patted down and stripped of their weapons. The rogue operators even knew to take the Marines military IDs out of their left breast pocket, where they snapped pictures of Herrera and his fellow Marines. Identifications. During this time, Michael occasionally shifted his glance back to the large UFO, where four F-350 sat with weapon cases and containers with an oxygen or humidity control unit, which held what Michael would later come to learn.

00;07;25;21 - 00;07;51;08
Unknown
We're human beings. The F-350 is loaded the supplies onto a platform below the craft. When the platform itself rose from the ground connected with the craft and the two connected pieces shot off westward, instantaneous. No rotor wash, no exhaust, no sonic boom. None of the surrounding vegetation was disturbed in any way. The Marines were told to turn around.

00;07;51;08 - 00;08;19;28
Unknown
Michael thought that this was it. They were dead until the operators began reloading the soldiers equipment and magazines back onto their persons, escorting the Marines back up to the slopes. The operators told Michael and his fellow soldiers they were not allowed to look back or talk about what they had seen breaking the hillside. The Marines ran back to the LZ, where a resident gunnery sergeant grew furious at the non-combat effect of Marines flying back to the USS Denver.

00;08;20;01 - 00;08;44;04
Unknown
An admiral debriefed the team, and a few days later, while on leave the battery, an SD card to Michael's camera were taken along with the fellow Marines cell phones. And finally, when the USS Denver tracked back to Okinawa, a man in USAF Blues with no name tag pulled Michael into his office, where he told him to never tell anybody of his encounter, regardless of chain of command.

00;08;44;06 - 00;09;23;08
Unknown
Discussing the event would lead to imprisonment or death. Michael was then forced to sign an NDA to never speak about the experience. And, what really triggered me into, being motivated to look into the case myself was hearing all of the negative reaction towards him, for reasons that I felt were really flimsy. You know, people were criticizing him because they didn't, you know, he said they didn't have radios and or like, because he he mislabeled the name of a rifle or something.

00;09;23;10 - 00;10;01;01
Unknown
And I just, I just thought that was pretty absurd to to completely dismiss a whistleblower when you're literally sitting here considering a story about a 300ft UFO, but because they didn't have a radio, that's too unbelievable for you, you know? So let's just dismiss the whole thing. If the UFO community did not have the, open mindedness and patience, and space to provide a whistleblower to, you know, give time to investigate and vet the story.

00;10;01;08 - 00;10;21;16
Unknown
And if we were just going to shut them down immediately for, like, really lame reasons, I like, how are we going to expect the general public to, to take this seriously if we can't even, you know, give it, give it a chance, you know? So, I mean, the other thing was like it dawned on me like, this is a military operation, and humanitarian operation.

00;10;21;16 - 00;10;55;11
Unknown
So there's a ton of photojournalism, journalists, you know, military reports and assessments that were done all around this operation. So I saw that as a great opportunity to begin digging into the details, to see if I could find any conflicts with, Michael's testimony. And I ended up finding the opposite, that that I was corroborating everything that I could find corroborated what he was saying.

00;10;55;11 - 00;11;24;14
Unknown
Now, obviously, that doesn't prove he saw a UFO, but it it does corroborate all of the details around that operation that he was on. And so, I, I made a post on Reddit, kind of, you know, detailing those things that I found Joey's first Reddit post titled verifying the events around Michael Herrera's UFO encounter, Part one, sought to confirm all the little bits and pieces of the military operation in 2009.

00;11;24;16 - 00;11;55;14
Unknown
Logically, if Michael could be found to be lying about any detail regarding the humanitarian mission, his whole testimony could be thrown out the window as another UFO wannabe, Joey provided documents, all evidence to support all of the context Michael provided, including the USS Denver was the sole ship assigned to support Indonesian military efforts. Regardless of Michael finding the strange, the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit was present at this operation.

00;11;55;17 - 00;12;22;15
Unknown
53 Super Stallion Choppers were used to deliver aid and finally the confirmation of hasty leaves through a blog post which detailed efforts done by the US forces to deliver supplies to critical and remote areas. Of course, none of this actually proves that Michael saw a UFO Austin service, but this post does confirm key smaller elements of his story, including accurately depicting the military op in Indonesia.

00;12;22;17 - 00;13;03;14
Unknown
Joey includes a call to action asking Michael to reach out for further investigation. So my plan was to do a part two where I would I wanted to figure out where the landing zone was, and so I thought if I could reach out to Michael and we could work together to figure out where the landing zone was, I have the 3D modeling background, so what I wanted to do was import that terrain, into, you know, some 3D modeling software and be able to perform like additional analysis to cross-check his estimates of distances and heights and scales of things.

00;13;03;16 - 00;13;27;17
Unknown
And I also thought it was important to illustrate the distances that are involved in this, encounter, because the landing zone was almost 7 or 800m away from where the craft was, was sighted with a, with a hill in between, in the middle of, of jungle. And so that was, that was really my, my only thought, for for reaching out to Michael.

00;13;27;17 - 00;13;50;15
Unknown
I had no idea it was gonna, you know, kind of spiral spiral much deeper into to what it has. I mean, how how rare is it that we get any sort of testimony that isn't that's literally just, you know, most times it's literally just testimony. It's just someone's verbal account of what happened. There's no evidence, there's no nothing.

00;13;50;17 - 00;14;16;06
Unknown
And here we have a military operation that has, you know, aerial surveys being conducted. I'm sure there's plenty of satellite imagery, you know, that exists. And just all of the different records that kind of track, the movements of, of things, you know, it just that reason alone seems like a very exciting case to dig into where you have a lot of opportunity to uncover data.

00;14;16;09 - 00;14;35;27
Unknown
Literally that same day that I emailed him, he called me that night, we spoke for about a half hour and, you know, I got the sense that he respected the amount of effort I put into that post and just the, you know, just putting in the work. I have a feeling it was part of why he started to trust me and respect me.

00;14;35;29 - 00;15;05;05
Unknown
Moving forward, you know, he started trusting me with, with certain sensitive information that that did help, you know, back up some of his, some of his claims, circumstantially, I'll say. Then he started telling me more about this insider, the discussion around this program. Insider who met with and disclosed leaks to Michael is where some followers of this case, including myself, justifiably raise red flags and heighten their skepticism.

00;15;05;07 - 00;15;25;12
Unknown
But who is this insider, and for what reason did he meet with Michael? What can Joey tell us about this meeting, and how can he prove Michael was flown out to a secure facility to meet with this shadowy figure? And also, do not worry, when we get to the actual contents of the meeting, we will of course, discuss all of the leaks that were told to Michael by this insider.

00;15;25;15 - 00;15;54;00
Unknown
Michael's first encounter with this insider was actually mentioned on his first public appearance on Stephen Greer's National Press Club panel, which, come to find out through recent reservations from yesterday from, somebody who came forward to Doctor Greer. I don't know who they are, but what they had told him and what he has told me is that this gentleman knows exactly what these were used for because they had, like a cylinder on the front, which is either for oxygen or what I hypothesized was for vacuum sealing.

00;15;54;03 - 00;16;22;05
Unknown
Which lead me to suspect that they were smuggling narcotics or drugs. Come to find out, it's more disturbing than that. This gentleman has firsthand account with this and says that it was for people. This insider, wanted to meet Michael in person, and so he, asked Doctor Greer to make the connection. And so, you know, he introduced the two or passed along phone numbers or whatever.

00;16;22;08 - 00;16;48;15
Unknown
And so Michael's telling me all this, you know, that this this insider wants to meet him and all this stuff, and and I found it very suspicious. You know, I found it very, strange that that not only would he have this, really incredible story about seeing a UFO in Indonesia. Yeah, a huge 300ft UFO, which is is pretty unique.

00;16;48;15 - 00;17;07;18
Unknown
I don't know, I personally don't know of too many stories like that that big. And now you're telling me that that literally an insider wants to meet you, like, come on, this is, you know, this is pretty outrageous, you know, how did, how did Michael react when he was approached by the insider? Was he excited? Was he skeptical?

00;17;07;18 - 00;17;28;27
Unknown
Was he possibly worried for his safety scare? He was. He was very he he I mean, the last time, if you think about it like the last time he's interacted with any of these people, they had guns pointed at him and, you know, were threatening to kill him and stuff. And and so now here's someone is, you know, allegedly associated with that.

00;17;28;27 - 00;17;57;13
Unknown
And, but he just felt like if he wants to move this forward, he's got to he's got to take the chance and do it. And for me, you know, at the time, this was pretty early on in my, interactions with Michael, and I didn't feel like I had the sort of relationship with him where I could, you know, ask questions or provide advice or anything like that.

00;17;57;13 - 00;18;26;25
Unknown
You know, I was basically just kind of respectfully, you know, taking information from him that he felt comfortable sharing with me. But I wanted to scream at him and say, dude, like, are you crazy? And mind you, I went back and forth, constantly through this period where I would allow myself to pretend it's all real and like, you know, let myself just kind of sit there for a minute and be like, all right, let's say this is all real.

00;18;26;28 - 00;18;50;28
Unknown
Holy crap. This is. He's crazy. Like he can't go and meet this guy. He's going to kill him, you know? And then there were times where I would be feeling the opposite and being like, okay, this is this is clearly like a set up. And he's telling me stuff, that he's telling me is sensitive, but in reality, it's, he wants me to leak it, but he's telling me not to.

00;18;50;29 - 00;19;09;16
Unknown
It's like reverse psychology or something. And, you know, I need to be really cautious here. And so that was, that was what was going through my mind at the time. And it was very much back and forth. But I also felt like I was in a pretty good position because this wasn't anything I had to take action on.

00;19;09;18 - 00;19;40;00
Unknown
I had reached out to him to kind of like try to figure out what the law was, and then it kind of just snowballed into this other thing. But I felt like I was in a great position because there was really no risk or harm in me, just letting things play out and see what happens. You know, Joey was rightfully, extremely confused and skeptical as to why Michael confided so much information to him about the insider and the meeting time, date, and location.

00;19;40;03 - 00;20;06;12
Unknown
It was then Joey actually realized Michael was using him as a dead man switch. Michael feared what might happen to him being taken out to an unfamiliar location by unfamiliar people, and in case he was in fact killed, Joey should release any and all information he had. That was what made me the most suspicious, because it was like he was trusting me with information without any real justification.

00;20;06;12 - 00;20;28;02
Unknown
And then I realized, you know, that he was going out to meet this guy. And I got the feeling that he was, you know, telling me this information in case something happened to him. And I called him out on it. And told. And, you know, he basically said like, yeah, I, you know, something happens to me while I'm out there, you know, I want you to release all this information.

00;20;28;05 - 00;20;55;10
Unknown
I'm very happy that Joey brought this next point up, as he has never actually talked about this publicly. The day before the meeting, Joey and Michael had a conversation about the meeting, and Joey recorded this conversation without Michael's knowledge. I called Michael and had a conversation with him about the meeting, and I recorded it without his knowledge. And I did that.

00;20;55;13 - 00;21;14;00
Unknown
Because I felt like I needed proof, in case I did need to, in case something did happen to him. And, and I couldn't get in touch with him, and I needed to reach out to someone to prove that, yes, I'm in touch with Michael, and these are the things he's told me. And now I can't get Ahold of him.

00;21;14;07 - 00;21;39;02
Unknown
I didn't think anyone would believe me unless I had some sort of proof that I was talking to him. So I recorded that. I think I actually shared that with you. Hey, Michael, it was a little time before I have to kick off this meeting here at 930. Oh. Okay. Yeah. Well, I just, you know, first of all, I wanted to check in with you, see how you're how you're doing, how you're feeling.

00;21;39;05 - 00;21;58;17
Unknown
Yes. Towards the meeting with these guys. And, you know, I'm nervous about a little apprehensive, but. Right. If this is going to get carried farther than I need to, you know, I need to speak to the horse's mouth, so to speak. So I just, you know, is where it is at this point. Yeah. Crazy. Yeah.

00;21;58;19 - 00;22;21;10
Unknown
I'm. Yeah, I'm just kind of checking in. I mean, like, jeez. So everything's basically all set for the meeting? Yeah. Tomorrow. For tomorrow. So that's. I arrived there around the clock. Yeah. Their time. And then there's. They're picking me up with that. To me, I think. I don't. They're putting me in right. Then I'm going to some.

00;22;21;12 - 00;22;45;14
Unknown
Apparently there's a facility out and, that they're taking me to. And then it's like somewhere to go see some things. So I don't know what that entails, but. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. And then you're going to touch base with me after afterwards at some point. Yeah. Okay. All right, Michael, well, be safe, my friend. And, look forward to touching base with you when you get back.

00;22;45;17 - 00;23;01;10
Unknown
Roger that. Man. Thank you for being involved with this, too. And, you know, I'm glad that you're checking up on me. Cool. You know, it's great. So, yeah, as soon as I get more information, if I'm able to release some things, after this meeting, then, I'll let you know. Okay. Sounds good. All right, buddy, thank you.

00;23;01;11 - 00;23;29;23
Unknown
All right. Bye bye. What stood out to me most about this conversation was the fear in Michael's voice. He sounded scared, like he didn't know what was going to happen to him. And yes, he did provide specific details. And also, Joey did tell Michael about this recording later on, so please don't hold that against him. Michael knows. But using this information provided by Michael, Joey was able to verify many of the details that Michael claimed.

00;23;29;27 - 00;23;53;13
Unknown
I think tracking flight records and such. There's other evidence that I can't share publicly. I think I did I did share that, like some censored, a censored version of that evidence with you. And guys, I have seen a lot of people dismiss or get on Joey's case for not sharing this evidence. He has, in fact shown me a censored version of this evidence.

00;23;53;15 - 00;24;19;21
Unknown
And if Joey is telling the truth, which I believe he is, and showing me an undiscovered version of this evidence, I can say with a high degree of certainty that this meeting did in fact take place. This isn't to say anything about what the insider showed or told Michael. I can't comment on that legitimacy, nor can Joey. We don't know the evidence, of course, is not mine to share, or to an extent, even Joey's.

00;24;19;24 - 00;24;48;22
Unknown
There is a larger behind the scenes investigation here being conducted that if shared publicly, could compromise the investigation or at the very least make it somewhat hairy. I personally hope that the finer details of this investigation and Joey's evidence will come to light soon. I essentially was able to prove that Michael was taken to a secure facility. It's how I refer to it with this insider.

00;24;48;24 - 00;25;11;04
Unknown
And so for me, and the thing is, is like, I didn't have to rely on any trust of Michael. Like, I didn't have to. Like, none of this is contingent upon me having to trust any word that any person has told me. This is objective data and evidence that I used to to verify this. When he got back, I,

00;25;11;06 - 00;25;46;05
Unknown
And we started talking. I didn't immediately reveal to him that I was able to track where he went. And so I use that opportunity to further vet. And, you know, you know, criticize, not criticize, but, validate, you know, his account. So I was asking him specific questions about timing. So at this location, Michael was both shown and told things by this insider.

00;25;46;07 - 00;26;09;01
Unknown
What was he shown? He hasn't told me what he saw there. He said he he signed an NDA. So what was Michael told? Strangely enough, this insider was okay with Michael telling Joey and the greater public about what he was told at this meeting. Now, Joey and I are both a little apprehensive to discuss these points, as we cannot back these up with any evidence.

00;26;09;01 - 00;26;32;19
Unknown
However, it's important to discuss anyways. I feel a little uncomfortable, like going through kind of the speculative stuff that this insider has told Michael, because it's nothing I've been able to verify. Well, according to this insider, he is an advocate for disclosure and has been in the program for decades. Remember guys, all of this is speculation and this could very well be purposeful.

00;26;32;19 - 00;26;53;21
Unknown
Disinformation by this insider were utter nonsense. But I want to talk about these statements due to the existence of the insider and the reality of the meeting. Fortunately, Joey has made a post on Reddit detailing this information, which will be on screen now and in the show notes. This is all content Michael has relayed publicly or given Joey permission to share.

00;26;53;24 - 00;27;19;27
Unknown
Within the USG, there are two groups studying UAP the blue Group and the black Group. The blue Group consists of programs with proper congressional oversight. Think arrow Data, Blue Book, etc.. Black Group is an organization founded in the 1940s to reverse engineer and high tech. The lack of oversight, accountability, and endless reach of this black group mirrors almost identically what is spoken about in the Wilson Davis memo.

00;27;20;00 - 00;27;52;11
Unknown
This black group has successfully reverse engineered night craft to an unknown degree of success, but utilizes these craft for operations. The flying crafts are considered, quote, boring tech. There are other technologies that are far more exciting and in the insiders words, utilitarian for humanity. MP like weaponry has been developed that can target and disrupt and disable UAP. Crash retrieval programs are able to lure UAP to locations where they are disabled via the EMP.

00;27;52;11 - 00;28;20;16
Unknown
Weapons and craft and bodies are recovered. Now we get into some of the real woo and troubling stuff. The program recruits people with quote, psionic abilities and quote referred to as P, often from Third world nations. These individuals are needed to interface with and control, and high tech recruits from these third world countries are often bargained with to join the program in exchange for security and safety of their families.

00;28;20;18 - 00;28;42;12
Unknown
Likely due to the permanent or semi-permanent isolation of the recruits, while in the program. This is the operation Michael stumbled upon in Indonesia. Many recruits actually die in the process of interacting with any high tech and this is due to heavy drugging to induce a calm meditative state. These recruits are treated like biological equipment in order to fly.

00;28;42;13 - 00;29;06;21
Unknown
Some interesting choice of words there and they try to craft a consciousness. Connection must be made. A black program pilot cannot fly in night craft directly if he does not have the desired psionic abilities mentioned. So the program has devised a method to connect a recruit to a brain interface machine, where the pilot controls the machine to control the person's intentions, thus controlling the craft.

00;29;06;24 - 00;29;30;12
Unknown
If true, and this is a big if, the implications of this program existing are beyond disturbing. But let's try and keep investigating. What else can Joey tell us about this insider? I do know that this insider is real, and I can say that because, boy, I don't know how. I don't know how I can publicly acknowledge how I know that.

00;29;30;15 - 00;30;04;11
Unknown
I will say that there are other people who have corroborate the existence of this insider to me personally. I know that he took Michael to this location, and so due to what I know, this location to be officially, it leads me to believe that this person has has quite a bit of authority to be able to bring him to this location in the nature in which he did.

00;30;04;14 - 00;30;26;20
Unknown
Because my you know, my first question is like, how the heck does anyone get to bring a random person, Michael Herrera, especially a civilian at the time, for sure. Yeah. Like how? Like that's impossible, right? Like, there's got to be all the security and like, you know, cross-checking and surveillance of, like, every person who's walking in and out of the place.

00;30;26;22 - 00;30;49;23
Unknown
And the way this all went down was just like, Holy crap, he literally did that. So, like, what are the implications of that? You know, so I know Michael was taken to this location and I know the insider exists. But I don't know if anything that insiders is saying is true. So the insiders provided Michael with a lot of leaks, you know, information about the black program.

00;30;49;23 - 00;31;15;19
Unknown
He's specifically involved with the clock, the crash retrieval aspect. So the question on my mind, and I'm guessing all of yours too, is why did this insider tell all of this to Michael? If this was a psyop, why bring Michael all the way to this black site and show him all this unknown stuff? And even if the insider is lying, this still does not account for Michael's experience in the UFO in 2009.

00;31;15;20 - 00;31;41;01
Unknown
That experience is not negated if this is a psyop to me, both sides of the coin seem somewhat logical and plausible. I often think back to the story of Paul Bennett, who in 1989 was driven to insanity by being fed false information about extraterrestrials by the CIA. This is a fascinating story I might cover one day, because it's really worth knowing.

00;31;41;03 - 00;32;01;26
Unknown
On the other hand, if this figure is pro disclosure but does not want to be public, it does make sense for him to use Michael as a vessel. Let's see what Joey thinks. These guys don't want to come out publicly. You know, they have a lot of a lot at risk. Personally they don't. They have no interest in being, like, public figures about this topic.

00;32;01;28 - 00;32;48;07
Unknown
There are allegedly a lot of factions within the program who aren't interested in this becoming, disclosed. And so, you know, there's there's personal risk with that as well. And so I think, you know, he saw in Michael, someone who was already comfortable with that risk of being a whistleblower. And because he had that connection of of understanding the operation that Michael had witnessed, felt that he would be a good person to, you know, try to reach out to something that raises suspicion about the insider for both Joey and myself, is the story of a book.

00;32;48;09 - 00;33;10;18
Unknown
A few weeks after the meeting, the insider told Michael he was in the process of writing a book under a ghostwriter. The purpose of this book was to hide truth and fiction, similar to Secret Machines by Tom DeLonge. This book is titled Sentinels of Ether. What sticks out to me as concerning here is the book was framed to be corroborating evidence to support Michael's story.

00;33;10;20 - 00;33;35;02
Unknown
However, the connecting threads are thin at best. In fact, this book is about an event that occurred in Mexico in 2004, in which a paramilitary group in the black program wipe out an entire J SoC team during an operation. The black team is described as transporting humans inside shipping containers to a hidden base in a mountain, which is similar to the containers Michael Herrera describes in his encounter.

00;33;35;04 - 00;33;59;29
Unknown
I didn't mention this earlier, but one of the things that Michael had been excited about, with this meeting, was he was supposedly going to be given some evidence that would support his his claims, you know, and this is what that ended up being was this this book? Yeah. And I'm like, how is a fictional book supposed to corroborate anything, you know?

00;34;00;03 - 00;34;26;20
Unknown
And it's not even about the event that Michael saw. It's something completely different that happened. The insider actually provided a two chapter manuscript of the book, currently under Doppler Review, to remove classified information. In the insiders own words, he is playing a scheme or 4D chess on Doppler. And of course, for those of you who don't know, Doppler is the Defense Office of Pre-publication and Security review.

00;34;26;22 - 00;34;54;18
Unknown
This is what David Gross is currently going through with his op ed right now, so he doesn't have any classified information. And he does, provide some context as to the sort of scheme that he's he's trying to play on Dops or where he's intentionally, you know, including certain information that he knows, you know, shouldn't be flagged by dops or because it's like deep black, projects that shouldn't be acknowledged.

00;34;54;18 - 00;35;15;27
Unknown
And he's trying to see if they'll catch it. And it I don't know, it just sounds it just sounds a little sketchy to me to, to be honest. In fact, the insider directly quotes quote, our intention is to put the DoD in a pickle by creating dilemmas. We are strategically taking advantage of the fact they must respond. They don't have a choice.

00;35;15;27 - 00;35;43;12
Unknown
No poker face. Any response will provide us with information, intelligence and inverse intelligence. One of the other things that Joey has more information on than almost anybody else are the thoughts and words of Michael's fellow platoon members, who were with him in Indonesia in 2009. According to the original Daily Mail article that was written on Herrera, the other 4 or 5 Marines in Herrera's platoon were too scared to come forward.

00;35;43;14 - 00;36;04;15
Unknown
Bar one text message that read, hey man, this is asking too much of me. It's not worth the risk. My family and military career far exceed anything. You are asking of me. It's not worth my life or jeopardizing my family. I know we go back, but this is asking too much. You need to get out of whatever you are in and don't get me involved.

00;36;04;19 - 00;36;31;22
Unknown
So I've talked to a handful of people who were in his platoon and were on that mission. On that ship, I would say not the not the the UFO mission, the alleged UFO mission. But I'll say, you know, the Indonesia relief effort mission or operation, I will say that out of those people that I have spoken to, all of them believe Michael is lying.

00;36;31;25 - 00;37;05;25
Unknown
Except for that. Well, except for one. There's one person that I've reached out to, and asked for permission to ask some questions about it, and he just said, no, thank you, and leave my name out of everything. But everyone else thinks Michael is lying. But the thing that's interesting is, you know, once I get into conversation with these people, they quickly reveal that, you know, because someone says very strongly, I know he's lying.

00;37;05;27 - 00;37;24;12
Unknown
My follow up question is. Oh, so you were boots on the ground with him in Indonesia. And their reply is, well, no, I was in a different squad or oh no, I was, I was I stayed on the ship, I didn't leave the ship. And so immediately I'm like, well, you can't possibly know he's lying because you weren't there.

00;37;24;15 - 00;37;53;27
Unknown
Like, how can you say, you know, he's lying? So, you know, that was really disappointing to hear. However, I still I still maintained conversations with these people because they did, you know, certain certain people provided some, you know, personal photographs that I was able to, you know, there was nothing crazy in the photographs, but it did prove that they were in, you know, the tabbing airport where the coordination efforts were, were happening.

00;37;54;03 - 00;38;28;03
Unknown
But there's one person who I do find very credible, who who speaks against Michael. I, I I'll just say his first name. His name is Nathan. And he was Michael's team leader, and he provided so I, I've had several, you know, text conversations with him, and he provided a photograph, that he alleges shows Michael and another marine on a helicopter.

00;38;28;05 - 00;38;57;28
Unknown
And he says they're all being flown into Indonesia. They're they they don't have rifles. Right. This photograph is important because if it is proven to be Michael, it kind of shows that he's lying about, something, you know, or, you know, most of the story gets kind of discredited because, you know, the big part of Michael's story was he had rifles and, you know, he was with different people.

00;38;58;00 - 00;39;18;18
Unknown
So, Michael, you know, I did share that photograph with with Michael. I didn't give him any context. I just said, do you know, do you know who's in the photograph? And he provided two names. And, you know, then I explained, you know, that the allegations that one of one of the people is him and and he denies it.

00;39;18;22 - 00;39;43;17
Unknown
He very strongly denies it. And what's interesting to me, to kind of play towards Michael, in a way, let's say Nathan's telling the truth. Let's say Michael did fly in with him without rifles. And let's say Michael was on that flight, right? What that would mean if he is lying about this UFO thing, that means he was thinking.

00;39;43;23 - 00;40;09;09
Unknown
Let me let me make up a story about a UFO. But also let me lie. And about a mission. I know I went on with my squad. Even though he knows there were witnesses, and he knows, you know, his photo is being taken. It just doesn't make any sense to me. Like, why would he? Like, he could have very easily just said, yeah, that is me in the photograph.

00;40;09;11 - 00;40;31;03
Unknown
But I also took a different flight. And later on, or earlier in the day, you know, he could have made it. So he could have just acknowledged that both things are true, and it would have totally negated that photographic evidence. The question of rifles, or lack thereof, in Nathan's alleged photograph, is crucial. And since Indonesia 2009 was a humanitarian mission.

00;40;31;06 - 00;40;52;12
Unknown
Marines were not supposed to be equipped with rifles. As I stated earlier, and what was actually confirmed to Joey by all the Marines he spoke to, the first wave of Marines in Indonesia were in fact armed, but subsequent deployments were not due to bad optics. Allegedly, an Air Force colonel yelled at the Marines and ordered them to stop utilizing rifles.

00;40;52;14 - 00;41;24;24
Unknown
And now, the reason why probably half of you are watching this video with a renewed interest in Michael Herrera, The Aero Historical Report, volume one. Within this report, Michael Herrera is all but named as somebody who testified to arrow, stating, quote, an interviewee who is a former U.S. service member said in that 2009, while participating in a humanitarian and security mission in a foreign country, he encountered U.S. special forces loading containers onto a large extraterrestrial spacecraft.

00;41;24;26 - 00;41;55;05
Unknown
And guys, I probably don't need to explain this to you, but Aero historical report volume one is not the most accurate report we've ever seen. In fact, in this 2 to 3 sentence summary of Michael Herrera, there are two factual inaccuracies one Michael never claimed he encountered U.S. Special forces. What he said was he encountered men with American dialects with American in gear but no rank, no insignia, no identifiers to where they belonged.

00;41;55;06 - 00;42;23;25
Unknown
And two Herrera said even from his first statement, he thought the craft he saw was human reverse engineered, not extraterrestrial. Is this just awful writing or purposeful disinformation? I lean more towards purposeful. I think this is so bogus and just in a two sentence summary, getting so many facts wrong. In my opinion, this sort of misreporting this on purpose and a symptom of the larger sickness that is this report.

00;42;23;27 - 00;42;52;16
Unknown
And I just want to touch on what seems to be a big misconception in the UAP community on Twitter and Reddit at the moment. On page 32, under the section, the UAP with peculiar characteristics refers to an authentic non-GAAP related SAP. Some people are confusing this statement as describing Michael Herrera. In the statement, it says Aira was able to correlate this account with an authentic USG program because the interviewee was able to provide a relatively precise time and location.

00;42;52;18 - 00;43;20;16
Unknown
As first pointed out to me by Joey. Michael narrowed down the timing of the event to within a couple days, but he did not know the precise time, and Michael did not know the exact location of the landing zone in Indonesia. In the same section, whatever person was writing this Ur report stated that the seemingly strange characteristics reported by the interviewee match closely with the platform's characteristics, which was being tested at a military facility in the time frame.

00;43;20;17 - 00;43;46;20
Unknown
The interviewee was there, but again, as Joey points out, Michael's encounter occurred in a remote part of the jungle in Indonesia, not a military facility. What was massively vindicating to Joey, and something that made him place more trust in Michael, and he even relayed this to me. Months before the Aero Historical Report, volume one. Michael had actually told Joey and provided him proof that he had testified to Aero.

00;43;46;23 - 00;44;16;03
Unknown
He said that they didn't record his testimony like they did. They weren't actually, like, electronically recording his testimony. There were just people in a skiff, and some of them had notepads and were just, like, taking notes occasionally. So the summary of his, his testimony in the report could literally just be the result of poor note taking.

00;44;16;06 - 00;45;02;27
Unknown
And I am perfectly comfortable with with accusing them of doing this intentionally because, you know, it certainly seems like something that they were trying to, prevent as much of a paper trail as possible and leaving a lot of the records up to interpretation. And I think that I think that was 100% intentional. So I don't I don't know if it was malicious, misquoting of Michael or just literally poor note taking and someone read someone else's notes and kind of summarized and misinterpreted or whatever.

00;45;03;00 - 00;45;25;04
Unknown
Did he testified to Doctor Kirkpatrick or was it just arrow employees? He said he says it was directly to Doctor Kirkpatrick. Was was in the room? Yeah. But another thing that I'll mention as well, something I kind of caught was, you know, speaking of that statute that that would, you know, provide, penalties to anyone who lies.

00;45;25;07 - 00;46;02;23
Unknown
I noticed that arrow was extremely careful in their report not to accuse a single whistleblower of lying or misleading. They emphasized how, you know, accepting they are of, the the fact that they, these whistleblowers believe what they're telling arrow. You know, and I think, again, I think that was incredibly intentional. It was really like the first kind of opening sort of statement in the in the report, if you really kind of highlight the key words there, it's literally all about belief.

00;46;02;24 - 00;46;23;14
Unknown
Yeah. Just emphasizing belief. And everyone's entitled to their belief. And they, you know, we can't we can't criticize, or hold it against anyone if they believe something. And and that was intentional. So that nobody could you know, I previously asserted that, you know, arrow would be forced to, to prosecute if they lied, but but that's not really the case.

00;46;23;14 - 00;46;50;15
Unknown
I kind of misspoke there. Really. I think it would still would have made an opportunity for other lawyers or organizations to, press charges against whistleblowers. If if they had lied and arrow would be kind of in a position potentially to provide evidence that supports that assertion. So they wanted to make sure to avoid that at all costs.

00;46;50;18 - 00;47;15;22
Unknown
And, and that's why they did that. You know, of course, I was fascinated to know if Michael had spoken to any other whistleblowers or people behind the scenes while Joey understandably couldn't comment. He did tell me something interesting that kind of made me jump for joy. I do know that he has. He has spoken to Jonathan, Wiegand, which which was pretty interesting.

00;47;15;25 - 00;47;38;25
Unknown
Because they did have sort of similar experiences. So, yeah, so that was really cool to think that, you know, Jonathan kind of had, gotten the chance to speak with someone else that, you know, had us had a similar experience. I personally believe it is probable that Michael and Wegen encountered the same insider paramilitary group.

00;47;38;27 - 00;48;01;24
Unknown
Too many similarities to men with American dialects and all black gear that appear to have highly skilled backgrounds. Of course, in wagons case, he did specifically see men in doughy rain jackets, which allowed me to conclude that these are likely a doughy ness team. Again, watch that analysis in my Marine's video, and then listen back to Michael's testimony and cross-reference the two teams.

00;48;01;26 - 00;48;23;21
Unknown
And lastly, guys, I kind of wanted to touch on some of the criticism that Joey has received. He has received so much support for his investigation, but also a lot of hate online people calling him Michael Schill, people calling him Michael's publicist, or even Michael under a pseudonym. And understandably so, he's received some flack for receiving evidence yet not making it public.

00;48;23;23 - 00;48;48;19
Unknown
Let's see what he has to say. I'm in no way his publicist. Yeah, I there's a few exceptions to that. Where there there were people that I felt, would be good, people to to interview him. One of them is Chris Lehto. So that was a case where I reached out to Chris and kind of did made the first contact and then introduced him.

00;48;48;21 - 00;49;11;13
Unknown
I just hope people will be open to, continuing to just follow, you know, more as, as the story unfolds because it's a very it's a very interesting case because you not only do have this historical event that happened in 2009, that still has a ton of data that has yet to be uncovered, even by myself.

00;49;11;13 - 00;49;31;27
Unknown
And, you know, yes, there's things that I do have privately that I can't share. But there's also, you know, other data that hasn't been uncovered by myself or anyone. But now we have this kind of current thing that's unfolding as we speak. I mean, there are there are things happening right now behind the scenes as we speak.

00;49;31;29 - 00;49;57;22
Unknown
So I think it's incredibly interesting and worth paying attention to. And, you know, no one has to make a decision about whether they think it's true or false at this point. I've been taking this a lot more seriously than I ever did previously, and I am giving the benefit of the doubt to the other people involved behind the scenes.

00;49;57;25 - 00;50;39;25
Unknown
And I'm and I am taking them very seriously, and I'm respecting anybody's request for me not to reveal, certain information because that's that's just the right thing to do. And people criticize me, and it's and it it kills me because I totally understand the criticism. I can't even argue the criticism because I did make the decision to kind of have this compromise where I'd reach out to people like yourself and other, you know, podcasters and, and, and journalists and, and people who I trust and, you know, reveal my identity.

00;50;39;25 - 00;51;05;24
Unknown
You know, you and I, we had a we've we've had video calls. You've seen my face. You know who I am? And I've shared some information with you that backs up some of my evidence of or, you know, shared some of my evidence that backs up my opinions on, on certain things. And so really, it's the best compromise I could come up with, you know, for now, I do hope to get to a point where I can be public and share more evidence.

00;51;05;26 - 00;51;24;21
Unknown
But for right now, that that was kind of the best compromise I could come up with. And one last thing I'd like to touch on is the connection between Michael Herrera and Steven Greer. I've touched upon this in almost every single one of my videos where there is a whistleblower, even my Marines video, because of Jonathan Wigand.

00;51;24;23 - 00;51;47;26
Unknown
So if you're interested to hear more, go check any of those out. But I think it's important to start separating in the whistleblowers from Doctor Greer. It's no surprise I have my problems with Doctor Greer, but I'm trying to take an approach where I will individually vet whistleblowers and people separate from Greer. I see a lot of people saying that these two are in cahoots, which is just blatantly not true.

00;51;47;28 - 00;52;15;12
Unknown
In fact, Michael himself has said that Doctor Greer has embellished or purposefully lied about details of his story. There's been some, interviews that Doctor Greer has done and everything like that, where he's told people that they put guns right to our head. That wasn't the case. These guys were standoff distance. Because it's easier to go like this than actually be at a standoff distance and try to rush somebody who has had a good distance can sit in and just shoot you.

00;52;15;14 - 00;52;37;09
Unknown
So we need to understand that Doctor Greer is probably one of the only avenues whistleblowers have to come forward that they know of before David Grush hopefully things change in the future and people start pursuing the avenues of Grush or maybe Carl Nell, or maybe if there's some changes, arrow. But it's important to kind of separate Herrera from Greer.

00;52;37;11 - 00;53;03;29
Unknown
Hey guys, thank you so much for watching today. I hope you enjoyed this longer. Deep dive into Miguel Herrera featuring Joey is not My Name. This video and a subsequent follow up have been a long time coming, as since my first video, Joey and I have become very good friends and talk almost daily, so I would like to thank him for trusting me with some of the more sensitive evidence regarding Herrera.

00;53;04;02 - 00;53;23;01
Unknown
This case is ongoing and I don't imagine there's going to be just one follow up video he and I make to this Michael Herrera case has almost consumed me of late. I think about it all the time. I studied all the time and I talked to Joey about it all the time. So this case is so fascinating to me.

00;53;23;01 - 00;53;46;12
Unknown
I can't believe I initially brushed it off by buying into the Greer hate, or buying into some of the kind of nonsensical thoughts of just diminishing his testimony and thinking he's fully because of some details that seem odd at first when hearing about his story. I am still torn on the insider in terms of is this guy conducting a psyop or telling Michael real information?

00;53;46;15 - 00;54;07;22
Unknown
I just don't have enough evidence right now to know. But what do you guys think? After hearing some more of this video and hearing from Joey, do you guys believe more in Michael or less? Has his credibility increased or decreased in your eyes? I'd love to hear from you guys because this case is so fascinating to me. Please guys, remember to like and subscribe.
