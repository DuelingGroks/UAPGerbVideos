What's going on guys. It's up. Curb. And thank you so much for joining me for this in-person interview with UMC vet and Aero whistleblower Michael Herrera. Before we get into this interview, there's just a couple things I want to touch on. I co-hosted this interview with my good friend. Joey is not my name. Many of you will remember him from my first video on Michael, or have seen him around Reddit and Twitter.

00;00;21;29 - 00;00;44;00
Unknown
As one of the first people to really start investigating Michael's claims of his experience in 2009, in Indonesia. Seriously. When we sat down to conduct this interview, we sought to really ask some of the lesser ask questions and lesser known details of Michael's encounter in oh nine and his claims of meeting a black program insider. So we do kind of expect you to be somewhat familiar with Michael story.

00;00;44;00 - 00;01;08;28
Unknown
At least know the base details of his online experience and his follow up claims. If you haven't, I highly recommend checking out my original video on Michael that I did with Joey or watch his Sean Ryan Show podcast appearance. Both are fantastic videos. I highly recommend checking them out if you're not too familiar with Michael story. If you'll remember back to my Marines and UFOs video, you'll recall this is the first time I ever covered Michael story, and I was super dismissive of him.

00;01;08;28 - 00;01;40;16
Unknown
Super skeptical. That's why after all these months of talking to Joey, talking to Michael, sharing meals with Michael, hosting Joey, and conducting this interview, I'm super excited to revisit this case as it's one I've been privately investigating on my own for quite a while. So without further ado, please enjoy this interview with Joey is Not My name and Michael Herrera.

00;01;40;18 - 00;01;58;27

So you guys get to the top of the hill. And of course, this is when you observe this object. Who which part of your team first observed this? It had to have been, It wasn't me. It was somebody else. And they were more pointing like, what is that? And so this was a big misconception for me at first.

00;01;58;27 - 00;02;16;26
Unknown
Joey had to kind of help me visually visualize this, as I'm sure it was for a lot of other people, too. You guys only saw a top triangular section and some lights of this. Not really lights the lights and happened until the thing actually took off. But you can see, I mean, if you're trying to think that these are two trees, right?

00;02;16;29 - 00;02;34;27
Unknown
And that's kind of like where you can see the top part of it, but then you see the other part, but you can't make up the whole size of it. Right. Because you have trees and everything distorting it. So really only we saw was something change in colors. Often this little thing that I had visual on and you see it moving around, it's like it's not a building.

00;02;34;27 - 00;02;50;18
Unknown
I mean, we thought it was a building at a point, but I mean, it's just off in the distance right there, and it's changing colors. Something that you have green vegetation sticks out like a sore thumb. It's easy to say if it was a building because, I mean, you'd expect kind of buildings would be in that area. But this area didn't have any.

00;02;50;19 - 00;03;06;22
Unknown
Those buildings didn't have anything like that. So who made the decision to kind of go forward and check this out? It wasn't me and it was the person in charge. And that's you as one that did that. As you approach the object, you could only still see just above the tree line, the top of the object, you could see the.

00;03;06;22 - 00;03;29;22
Unknown
So when we got down that hill, and it was something we, we weren't allowed to do, obviously, because you're not supposed to abandon your wood. Whatever your post. Yeah, I'm curious about that. Can you describe the like what was going on at the LC at the at the time where you guys decided, I mean, to make this decision is risky decision, right?

00;03;29;23 - 00;03;51;04
Unknown
To go and check out whatever this was. So I don't remember much going on at that LC. I just remember taking video of that helicopter, those off in the distance. It wasn't like it was super close. Did you guys feel like that helicopter was like part of your responsibility to guard or or was it like we had assume that there probably was other people there or probably other Marines on board?

00;03;51;09 - 00;04;15;05
Unknown
There were probably dropping off in that area. That would be my assumption. I don't remember thinking anything like that back then, you know, 14, 15 years ago. Yeah. I mean, I can imagine, you know, whatever you guys saw was something that wasn't it was abnormal. And, you know, yeah, curiosity is a good thing to an extent. But I tell people all the time, curiosity is what kills a cat.

00;04;15;07 - 00;04;33;03
Unknown
And it's something in this way that it changed our lives. Yeah. I mean, it wasn't it wasn't a light decision. It was a no, it wasn't a risky decision. And you guys made the choice. And, I mean, we didn't even rock around in the chamber. It's just like we weren't expecting a really get into anything like that. You know?

00;04;33;03 - 00;04;53;28
Unknown
I was just walking down and trying to see what that is. And then if it wasn't nothing, we're just going to go back up the hill and resume to what we were doing. And obviously it led to what we experienced. When you're walking, you know, you guys are at the top of the hill. The decision is made to go check this thing out and at the top of the hill, you don't actually see any people.

00;04;53;28 - 00;05;19;11
Unknown
You didn't see those the trucks yet? Nope. You're just seeing the top of the craft. So you guys go down the moment of interception with these guys. Can you describe. I think I think what gets lost on a lot of people is how fast it happened, and how quickly they took control of the situation. I mean, what was your first impression when you saw these guys?

00;05;19;13 - 00;05;41;19
Unknown
Well, I heard people yelling at us. That's what got my attention. And when we saw weapons in their hands pointed at us, you're not going to move. You're not going to raise your weapon up, because obviously that's point. And then obviously, and during the briefing, I had touched on in numerous interviews that there was a possible Seal team that was out there trying to handle things that they were tasked on, what they were specifically doing.

00;05;41;19 - 00;05;58;16
Unknown
I don't know, but I remember in the wardroom that that's what they were talking about, having some sort of element of, U.S. Navy Seals there. And for a second we thought it may have been them, and we're just like, oh, shit, here's these guys. You know, they don't. Then obviously we were going to talk or something or just go let it be cool.

00;05;58;16 - 00;06;16;09
Unknown
And these guys were not these guys were not carrying themselves the Seals and they didn't have anything identifying on them. And obviously they were screaming at us, telling us to put our weapons, you know, put our hands up in the air because we had slings on our stuff. Right? So that's when we're putting our hands up in the air and every single one of us did the same thing.

00;06;16;10 - 00;06;43;04
Unknown
It's not like, I mean, how are we going to raise a weapon that doesn't even have a full chamber? What are you going to do at that point? If you even rack that round and try to bring it up, they've already got their muzzles pointed at you. It's almost like a police officer coming up to your vehicle when they do a traffic stop and they feel threatened, or they may have an indication that your vehicle matches a description of somebody who has had a gun pointed at them, for example, where they would believe that it's reasonable suspicion for them to deploy their firearm.

00;06;43;06 - 00;07;07;29
Unknown
Are you going to move suddenly and make them think you're going to reach for something? And he just blast, you know? And how did these men approach you in a tactical column, a picture we were in. We were the one that was in a tactical column they had. So if I was looking at this and we kind of started and that's when we naturally kind of spread out, like walking towards them, and that's when they basically had four guys on this side and they have four guys on on this side.

00;07;08;02 - 00;07;38;08
Unknown
And, I talked to numerous special operators about this type of tactic. And they called a nosebleed, which is where they have, basically interlocking fields of fire with this direction on one target. It's a very rookie, easy thing to do. And, these guys, they were they already had that position. So it tells me that maybe there could have been more operators that were around that area, maybe on the other side of the craft, on the other side of where the trucks may have went off, which I can see them go off anywhere.

00;07;39;20 - 00;07;58;21
Unknown
But from what I've been told, there was more than just those guys there. So if we would have gotten into any kind of conflict, we were severely outnumbered already. At what point did the craft become fully visible? When we got to the bottom of the hill and we walked a little bit forward and I started to clear out, and that's when this thing was just sitting there.

00;07;58;26 - 00;08;20;07
Unknown
And then they approached the men, approached you right up here. We noticed that soon as we broke that threshold of getting into that clearing is where they basically had us intercepted. It's not like we could run behind anything because you can't. Right. And the trees weren't like big red oak trees. We could hide behind. I remember the trees probably being as big as this water bottle at least.

00;08;20;07 - 00;08;37;21
Unknown
How thick? Probably a little bit thicker. But that's not enough to stop anything. It's not enough to hide behind and not get hit, you know. So it's you know, everybody has the whole they think they're John Wick until they're in that situation. But it's like, I would like to see anybody else in that situation to see what they would have done.

00;08;37;23 - 00;08;55;23
Unknown
Because knowing what type of operators we encountered now that I've already been through all of this, been briefed on it, been included to an extent, none of us would have been a match for those guys. Yeah. And so what did these men do as they train the rifles on you as they approach you? So we heard they were pointed.

00;08;55;23 - 00;09;16;12
Unknown
They were screaming at us. You can actually hear them flip everything off safe. And, because it's not a click. And where we were at, obviously there's not a lot of noise coming from the hill, obviously, because everything that's going on over there is basically silent because you have a hill blocking everything, and then the craft's not emitting any kind of noise except for that, that little hum or that guitar amp.

00;09;16;14 - 00;09;37;24
Unknown
I mean, it's not exactly like a guitar amp or like a transformer, but something similar to that. You actually replicated. Pretty good to it. So and that wasn't as audible compared to when everything started to go on. And when, you know, when they had us, you know, because we weren't at the, at, where we just broke that threshold right there, we actually pulled up a little bit more as they were telling us to.

00;09;37;26 - 00;09;59;16
Unknown
And, so they had their weapons on every single one of us, and there was only six of us. There was eight of them, which means that it's easy for them just to. I mean, I don't even know if their weapons are full auto and they probably could be ours or not. There are only three round burst or semi-automatic, and most of the time they teach us to shoot in a semi-automatic, you know, one round per person, a kill shot at least.

00;09;59;16 - 00;10;16;22
Unknown
So, I mean, it's not a headshot. I mean, you have a tee box and what you're trained for combat, marksmanship, but these guys could have full automatic force. I wouldn't rule it out, you know? Which means that they just need to. Each person doing a couple round bursts, 3 to 5 round bursts. I mean, it's going to get everybody where we were at.

00;10;16;25 - 00;10;36;05
Unknown
Now, one thing that people bring up, is, you know, you did have you had your camera, you at the top of the hill, you actually got some pictures of what you got. I remember, at least a couple photographs, but I remember a video as well. That's. I remember a video. That's when I had a dump pouch, which all of us did have a dump pouch.

00;10;36;05 - 00;11;06;21
Unknown
Yeah, but, I had it right here. All the time. And that's where we basically put expanded magazines, because you're not going to drop them because you have to reuse them. Right? So and it also helped to if you had, carry extra ammo because if you had some malfunction or sometimes we use the size with because my had regular saw drum pouches on my stuff where I could put a drum here and a drum here, and then I had grenade pouches up here, and, most of the time I would just put magazines and whatever the easiest side to reach was, and that's basically what I had.

00;11;06;21 - 00;11;30;20
Unknown
So we didn't have, like, M4 or, M16 pouches. I had saw drum pouches where I had all the magazine, which we had a combat loader had six mags. They disarmed you. Right? That was kind of their first, like once they approached you. You've described how they were very methodical and how they, they did that. They wanted to gain control of the situation, which they had that control.

00;11;30;20 - 00;11;56;07
Unknown
Right. But they're going to sleep better because they took our weapons from us and swung them. And and going through making sure that we had our magazines out wasn't like they were spending us like some law enforcement officer checking you, tracking around your ankles, anything like that. Right. They're not doing that. The only thing that they searched us with was our military ID is where they knew they were out, which is what my suspicion was that these guys were former military at some point, because they knew exactly where ideas were.

00;11;56;09 - 00;12;13;28
Unknown
And you said they interacted with your IDs with something that what we would recognize today as a modern day smartphone. Yeah. So they had, something that I referred to as a batch system that we were trained on, which is like a biometrics and tracking system that could be the acronym for it. But I just remember saying, that's and they try that first.

00;12;14;01 - 00;12;33;10
Unknown
So they put that away and they had these things. I mean, it wasn't like because iPhones were kind of bulky back in the day, and they had blackberries and they had a Sony Ericsson MP3 phone that was pretty bulky. And, they had something that was really thin and that's what they were using. So it could have been something that was comparable.

00;12;33;10 - 00;12;51;11
Unknown
But then again, I don't know. So while you're getting searched, the craft is in the background for anybody that hasn't heard you describe this craft, can you tell us what it looks like? So I remember, as because there was corners, which means to me is an octagonal shape. Actually. Could you would you mind drawing it for us?

00;12;51;13 - 00;13;09;19
Unknown
Let's see. I got pens over here. Let me. I like that idea. That would be cool. And you know what? I'm going to move. All right, so what did this thing what did this craft look like? Okay. So and this is going from our point of view right. That I can remember. So I'm just going to say this is like vegetation.

00;13;09;19 - 00;13;34;08
Unknown
Right. And this is to represent that clearing when I remember is kind of like a pyramid, shape at the top like this. Because I remember seeing some shading the some were kind of brighter than others like this. Then I remember it doing like this. And then I had corners right. This may be looking a little bit strange, but this is just a rough draft.

00;13;34;10 - 00;14;03;28
Unknown
Used to be a better artist back in the day, and I remember seeing these vents. At least that's what it looks like on each of the corners. Like this. So the vent here, and it was like it was positioned on the lines like this. And then on each corner when this thing took off, it had lights that would pop on, which would have been like red, yellow, green and blue are the only ones I remember that kind of had a line that went like this.

00;14;04;01 - 00;14;28;11
Unknown
And the, it had some sort of scale pattern that, you know, I estimate is octagonal, but it could be it could honestly be circular. It could be square. I wasn't close enough to depict it. But, this is where this was the blackest, darkest thing that I have ever seen in my life. As almost like light got absorbed into this.

00;14;28;11 - 00;14;52;10
Unknown
And I don't know if this is just because of the craft. It may help with a function, but, it was probably third graders or something that say they can probably do a better job of this, and I'd probably agree with them. So now what about the platform? The platform underneath was kind of like it was raised like this, not off the ground, but just like an incline, and then went underneath like this.

00;14;52;13 - 00;15;16;03
Unknown
And it was run the same kind of, length as a craft. And I had kind of some points on it as well, which, you know, obviously it fits under their craft. And we saw that happen. And it wasn't like where we were at. I would say this was approximately even the same distance as it was. There was not like it was on the lighter materials on here that I remember seeing.

00;15;16;05 - 00;15;44;13
Unknown
But then you have, the drastic figures. So I'm just going to draw them black because these are black team guys. I know this is not a Van Gogh or a, Mona Lisa drawing, but I'm just trying to gather everybody's attention to see how what I can recall is this and all these guys, we were essentially in this area kind of online, or five.

00;15;44;13 - 00;16;04;07
Unknown
Six. Right. And we weren't, like, evenly spaced out, but you guys can kind of see how there's six of us. There's eight of them. They've got good field of view. We can see this going on in the background. And I'm gonna draw a line through this, but basically with the directions or the trucks came from were from our left.

00;16;04;09 - 00;16;22;29
Unknown
So they're coming up and then they would go like this. I don't remember I don't remember seeing them go off the platform and going somewhere else. I just remember them going on here. But then we're also facing the fact that we're dealing with these guys at the same time. So our focus is going back and forth. One, you don't see anything that looks like that ever.

00;16;23;01 - 00;16;46;12
Unknown
Two, you're not in a situation where that happens either. So as I wish there was more details that I can remember aside from that. But that is what I briefly recall as far as what the craft looked like. Besides changing colors from a light matte gray to a dark matte black, the whole thing. And so before this craft took off, what did this platform do?

00;16;46;13 - 00;17;16;00
Unknown
So this craft kind of sunk down a little bit like this. This platform itself raised up and there were trucks and other crates. I don't remember seeing the trucks where they could have been because where we were at and mind you, I didn't see it as it started going up. I saw it when we were going back and forth, and the only thing that got my attention and I'm sure got everybody else's attention, I'm only speaking from my point of view, was the only thing that got my attention was something was moving.

00;17;16;07 - 00;17;35;26
Unknown
And because your eyes are used to tracks movement, right, it's just something that gets your attention. So when I saw that raising up, it was already what I'd estimate over our if we're only five, 10 to 6ft tall is probably or almost ten feet off the ground, did it raise rapidly or in kind of a slow motion? Not super rapid.

00;17;35;28 - 00;17;55;01
Unknown
It was enough to kind of be slow, but still enough to where you could catch it. But I don't remember seeing any kind of containers going up with it or trucks or nothing. I just remember seeing the front profile, the truck with a trailer behind it, and that how it's why I was able to see that cylinder in front of that container.

00;17;55;01 - 00;18;14;04
Unknown
Let's get another piece of paper and draw the trucks. Okay. And actually, I want to show you this too. That drawing is going to be worth a lot of money someday. Oh, yeah. That. Yeah. Let me do this. Oh, I get a suit. It's a cool. It's a cute. This is a probably my favorite part of the interview you draw on.

00;18;14;04 - 00;18;39;27
Unknown
This stuff is awesome. I feel like I'm in kindergarten, showing off the colors you recognize when it's cool because it, like, it helps you. Yeah. Describe like as your as you're doing it, you know. All right. So all right trucks. All right. So what do these trucks, the containers with them. Could you describe those. Yeah. So, like I said, I only saw from certain profiles.

00;18;40;00 - 00;18;59;17
Unknown
And what I remember distinctly with these, I don't remember seeing, like, a Ford logo or nothing like a Chevy Duramax on the hood or nothing like that. We're obviously we're kind of far away in comparison to that. So, I'm going to draw three different views or profiles, which I remember seeing these trucks. So the first one is going to be as if it was coming towards us.

00;18;59;19 - 00;19;22;02
Unknown
So there's going to be like a headlight here. There's like a grille right bumper. And it had like I remember having like kind of like a hitch is what I'm assuming. And then, Just another headlight here.

00;19;22;05 - 00;19;28;21
Unknown
Again, I'm going to apologize ahead of time that this isn't going to be.

00;19;28;24 - 00;19;47;22
Unknown
A remember, seeing now when you say you didn't see logos like you didn't see Ford or. Yeah, I didn't see anything like that. Stated what kind of truck they were though. Yeah. That's my eyes. The bodies. Yeah. And I would say that they're Ford F-350. Yeah. Is what I would assume they work. Did you just say the insignia was.

00;19;47;24 - 00;20;10;07
Unknown
Yeah. They took. Yep. Gotcha. What I do recall seeing is I had like this thing is on the sides here, kind of like vents, but they're not really vents. And, it's kind of remind me of what they had on, military Hummers for night vision. So that's kind of what they had on there, which tells me that they run these at nighttime as well.

00;20;10;10 - 00;20;36;01
Unknown
And these were like big, aggressive off road tires or a truck bed. Okay. You can kind of see these cases which are Pelican cases on the back. And what are Pelican cases for anybody who doesn't know. I mean, it's it's a brand, but these are weapons where I mean, because we had the same ones that we transport weapons with, not just do they carry small arms munitions.

00;20;36;02 - 00;20;50;15
Unknown
Okay. Stuff like that. So then this was hooked to a trailer that had four wheels like this. Okay. Trailer.

00;20;50;17 - 00;21;08;09
Unknown
And the only thing I remember seeing of this container, it had the ridges kind of like a shipping container, but not much. They had the cylinder that's kind of on the front right here.

00;21;08;11 - 00;21;36;15
Unknown
So I wanted to show you this. Let me just throw this right in front of that sort of that camera gets it and you think that looks identical. But then again, now the other thing. So remember seeing that having for or two tires on each side. So dual axle. Yep. So this was another thing I found where they actually have the connect box on top of it.

00;21;36;18 - 00;22;00;07
Unknown
With more aggressive tires. But this looks shockingly familiar because that's the that's like the type of I mean that's a ship and crate. You know, I think this is called a tri con configuration. So they're all standardized like the sizes and stuff. And these were outfit. They had these cylinders on the front right here. That would what I, you know, come to find out, it's actually auction supply.

00;22;00;26 - 00;22;23;15
Unknown
Yeah. So draw those cylinders okay. So I'm going to draw I'm going to black it out completely because the cylinder itself was too black. And that's why an initially when you saw this you hypothesized this might be humidity control for some rust. Right. That's what I testified because I didn't think it was people that was in my in my thought process at the time.

00;22;23;27 - 00;22;44;08
Unknown
And we'll talk about it in a little bit. But so you testified to arrow before you did the NPC in two to play 23. Okay. Yep. That was I had testified last year to arrow. It was late April. Okay. Late April 2023. Yep.

00;22;44;11 - 00;23;10;16
Unknown
All right. So that's kind of the view that that's really so. And then obviously the side view. So cylinder is basically spanning the whole width of the container okay a small one large hole width. Correct. All right. So here's where the tires would be from the side profile of that trailer. Of course there was no white wheels. It was all black.

00;23;10;18 - 00;23;17;07
Unknown
I remember seeing kind of the back.

00;23;17;10 - 00;23;25;05
Unknown
Okay. And then this container right here.

00;23;25;07 - 00;23;48;21
Unknown
This is the cylinder from a side view. Okay. Truck bed right here. How many trucks total do you remember seeing? Four. Four. And it each one also have weapons crates or just. Yes. Each one of them had these what you would call parking cases. Okay. But just, weapons cases is what they definitely look like. Where the case opened closed, closed.

00;23;48;21 - 00;23;53;29
Unknown
Okay.

00;23;54;01 - 00;24;13;28
Unknown
And the windows, I remember being kind of dark. So could you recall any other operators or people in the in the trucks besides just the drivers? I remember one truck, that one on the platform and now the door. At least some of the doors open. I can't recall. Were there any people standing on the platforms or. Okay, I don't remember.

00;24;14;15 - 00;24;36;21
Unknown
But I, I don't remember seeing people on the platforms. So that is kind of. And these are black, of course. Right. So that's a side view of what that is. Right. Okay. Which I mean obviously these were black. The shipping container was black. Everything like that. The other profile going to draw is going to be from the rear.

00;24;36;24 - 00;24;55;16
Unknown
Did each truck have a shipping container attached to it? Okay. So here's a container right here. Remember seeing the bars hatch doors on the back. Yep. Like this okay. Can't really see the cylinder at this point. But just and they cannot be in there.

00;24;55;18 - 00;25;18;04
Unknown
Okay. You also said that the they were up armored. Yeah. I mean, so you mean by so they're, they looked a little beefier, thicker material. You know what I mean? Like, they look like they'd be bullet resistant, okay. Because they look, I mean, you can see a regular truck, and it's kind of like, okay, it's a regular truck, but these look like they were, reinforced.

00;25;18;04 - 00;25;28;26
Unknown
Kind of like a Secret Service car. Yeah, to an extent. Okay. All right, so there's a container like that.

00;25;28;28 - 00;25;47;17
Unknown
Which were not elevated. But this is just to put perspective of, of the truck. And just so how we were seeing it from the back, that's the only views that I remember seeing these trucks because you were in front of the craft and they kind of came out in a little bit of a circle like this, and then went on that direction.

00;25;47;17 - 00;26;07;19
Unknown
Okay. And it wasn't like they went straight. So they were going up to that platform. Okay. So you see the craft, you're basically getting weapons checked, weapons stripped from this team. What happens then? So they're going through each of us taking our stuff. They take our magazines out of our pouches and they kick them off. They got one guy off in the distance that I remember was a standoff distance, like more than ten feet.

00;26;07;22 - 00;26;27;11
Unknown
So obviously we try to run and grab our stuff and he just cannot wait us up. If he wanted. Did he have a different rifle platform to the the main guys? Yeah. So same loadout. They all had the same stuff. Yeah. They had the same kind of I mean they may have different attachments, but I remember most of part seeing, a cogs on each one of them with the Pac 16 illuminators on those as well.

00;26;27;11 - 00;26;46;07
Unknown
I remember seeing one thing I've always been curious about. Did did you notice any of them like talking on the radio to one guy had a radio and I don't remember him talking to anybody. I just remember seeing that. And what the antenna coming up that he had pressed to his vest. But he was a main guy that was kind of telling people what to do.

00;26;46;14 - 00;27;10;08
Unknown
Yeah. And he was mainly the one besides another guy that was yelling shit at us, like, it will fucking kill you. You know, it's easy to get lost out here. Did it seem like, you know, when they intercepted you guys? Obviously there was there was there were other guys in the trucks doing their thing. Did it did you have the impression that, like, all of a sudden they were like, oh shit, we need to wrap this up and get out?

00;27;10;08 - 00;27;40;00
Unknown
Or were they kind of just not really even caring about? I don't think they were kind of caring was they may have not even saw what was going on. They could have. I mean, yeah, I don't know. That's speculation at this point. Yeah. Clearly we're we're getting into split speculation. There. But yeah, I'm just it's like I also think about the fact that this, you know, the earthquake, you know, the whole reason this operation was there was because there was an earthquake on it was the end of, or the 1st of September or end of October.

00;27;40;00 - 00;28;10;25
Unknown
It was the end of September. And then to I think it was September 30th, if I'm not mistaken. Don't quote me on that. Yeah. But yeah. No, I think that's I think that's correct. So, and then, you know, the Denver shows up on the ninth. So we're, you know, nine, ten days after the initial earthquake and, you know, just, you know, obviously speculation here, but it's like it kind of seems weird that why would this operation be occurring nine days after the earthquake?

00;28;11;10 - 00;28;36;05
Unknown
You know, of course, afterwards, you've you kind of been told, like, what that operation was all about. And, you know, recruiting people in disaster struck in areas. But who's to say that was like, maybe they had been conducting those same operations all week long. They could have been that could have been. And believe me, those are some questions I've asked some of these gentlemen that I'm working with.

00;28;36;05 - 00;28;55;14
Unknown
And they know. They don't know because everything's compartmentalized. I'm hoping one day, maybe one of them that I come across does know, because I'm going to ask him a lot of questions because, I mean, I mean, just like anybody listening or watching to this or anybody who's wants this to come out and come forward, I'm 100% with them.

00;28;55;14 - 00;29;13;00
Unknown
I want this to come full circle just like anybody else. I'm just as impatient. The only difference that separates me from anybody else is the experience, but also having knowledge of what's going on to an extent, at least with what I've been exposed to. I just have a little bit more information. So you get to the point, you know, they're threatening you.

00;29;13;15 - 00;29;34;17
Unknown
They give you your weapons back and tell you to go, you know, back back up the hill. Don't look back when you get to the top of the hill. What do you see happening at the LC? I just remember me because I remember once we broke the top and all of a sudden I remember seeing some of our guys just start running.

00;29;34;17 - 00;29;54;29
Unknown
So I'm following suit with them, right? Because if anything's going to happen to us, it's going to get the attention of everybody else. And I remember seeing some people, but it wasn't like it was like close up. I just remember when we ran back, we had our weapons strapped to our back that were very tight. Uncomfortably tight. Right.

00;29;54;29 - 00;30;18;04
Unknown
Because it's compressing your vest. And I remember having a gash on my, right part of my neck because we had, like, a yoke or like a collar on our vest. And I remember that when they put that through that it actually kind of the slings we had one the best quality. And they're not, soft, they're plastic and polymer, whatever it is or cloth, whatever material they make out of them.

00;30;18;04 - 00;30;38;26
Unknown
And it's very hard. So it kind of cut you up a little bit. And then I remember us getting back there, and I remember seeing a couple people off in the distance as far as some villagers or whoever, the civilians were, and there was some other military personnel. I don't remember them being Marines. I don't remember what they may have been.

00;30;38;26 - 00;30;54;05
Unknown
The the Indonesian military could have been there. But they were still off kind of at a, at a distance compared to where we were at. And there was this gunnery sergeant that was there. And I've never seen this guy before. I don't know if he was attached to the ship. I don't know if he was brought by any other means.

00;30;54;10 - 00;31;16;03
Unknown
I have never seen this guy before. Now, Gunnery Sergeant, you know, you recognize it because you see his rank right now. Gunnery Sergeant, that rank is is specific to the Marines, isn't it? Correct. Okay. So when you when you speculate that maybe he was assigned to the ship or attached to the ship, I think you kind of say, what do you mean by that?

00;31;16;03 - 00;31;38;20
Unknown
Like how they each ship, if they're from my understanding, again, I don't know, 100%, but from my understanding, there are some ships that have like a combat, loading group or somebody who's basically loading marine stuff onto a ship. I don't know the specific I can't remember what it's called. They also have some Marines that are red patches.

00;31;38;20 - 00;32;03;01
Unknown
They have a red patch on their, on their, cover, and then they have red patches on some of their, I think on their blouse. They have some on their, their shoulder pocket and some of their cargo pockets. And this guy didn't have those, that I can recall. Anyway, he may have he may not have. I don't remember, but I remember those rank because obviously it was a little hard to see it because woodlands have black shapes.

00;32;03;01 - 00;32;27;04
Unknown
And sometimes that distorts that. And if you end up calling somebody by the wrong rank, you get to pay for it with push ups or get screamed at. Right? So which honestly, if I was in that position, I would have screamed at people and tried to fuck with them too for getting my rank wrong. So it happens. But, when you, when you ran back to the LC, you were running towards the helicopter.

00;32;27;08 - 00;32;47;21
Unknown
No. Okay. The helicopter was not there. Yep. Okay. So he had he had a radio that he was talking with. Okay. And he was communicating with whatever the pilots or whoever it was. So what happened when we got there? He kind of like, first of all, for security, why do we have our weapons slung on our back? That's out of place.

00;32;47;21 - 00;33;06;01
Unknown
No Marines going to have that going on when. And that's what I think he was mainly more upset with was because that we were supposed to be our weapons proper, no magazines. And you know, which obviously they put our stuff in, but they put it in to where be very inconvenient to try to load it up and then go deal with it.

00;33;06;04 - 00;33;37;05
Unknown
So I think that thinking back to that, I think that that's mainly why he was upset was because, okay, well, you guys look fucked up is mainly what his what I would assume. Right? I'm just speculating at that point. But I remember us stepping off to the side, off in the distance a little bit, and we're basically squaring ourselves up or taking our weapons off and off of each other, giving it to us, putting a magazine in and having, resume the normal carry.

00;33;37;10 - 00;33;52;06
Unknown
And so this gunnery sergeant is standing just in the clearing where the LZ where you guys were dropped off. Correct. Was he surrounded by a platoon of Marines, or was just this gunnery just him and other people, other people off in the distance so they may have linked up and then he probably told them to go away or whatever he was doing.

00;33;52;06 - 00;34;11;13
Unknown
I have no clue. And then because he was on the radio, that's when, siege 53 came in and picked everybody up. Now, on the siege 53, did you recognize the pilot? Was this the same helicopter that dropped you off? I don't recall, okay. I just remember seeing the 53, and that's when it landed and we just boarded up on that thing, I don't remember.

00;34;11;13 - 00;34;27;26
Unknown
I mean, obviously, our point of view. I don't remember looking at the pilot. I never had a chance to. And it's the same thing with this. I don't know specifically who was flying or what. And so nobody said to the gunnery sergeant what, what you guys just experienced. Yeah. Okay. So you came to the LC, you got off the helicopter.

00;34;27;26 - 00;34;52;04
Unknown
That helicopter left, you go to the top. At a certain point, a second helicopter comes at a different location. Correct. Drops off supplies. Yes. Was that the what? That had a cargo net? Yes it did, because you. Because I took pictures and video of that. So that helicopter is is dropping that net and Yea that's when you crest the hill.

00;34;52;09 - 00;35;12;20
Unknown
Yeah. You know kind of at some point there you crest the hill to go investigate the craft. Yeah. You come back like that. Helicopters now gone. Yeah. What I'm assuming is they drop the cargo off and then they may have landed and let people out. But by the time I mean, that's. By the time you came back, there was no helicopter that was there.

00;35;12;21 - 00;35;33;06
Unknown
Okay? No, the helicopter was gone. But then there was obviously the supplies that they had. They had dropped off after the disc. So did you see do you remember seeing what was happening with any of that like were there I well I remember seeing people over there but and there could have been supplies, I mean, but they were off at a good distance and so where the, where the gunnery sergeant was, he, was he near some supplies too.

00;35;33;08 - 00;35;56;01
Unknown
He had I if I can recall, there could have been some boxes or something he was messing with that was there. There may have been boxes I don't really recall. I mean, why like, would he have even. Is there, is there like, a chance that, like, he didn't even know you guys were there and he was just, like, could have been the case.

00;35;56;01 - 00;36;11;27
Unknown
What the hell is he you got, like, where are you guys coming from? What's going on? It could have it could have been a case. I mean, like I said, I don't I, I really don't know. Yeah. It's speculation and but I just remember seeing a gunnery sergeant there who's like, you guys look fucked up. And, you know, he was yelling at us for that reason.

00;36;11;28 - 00;36;30;02
Unknown
So and so from, from the period of time, from that period of time to when you left the LC, you were basically just doing what? Just like hanging around waiting for the helicopter to, to. Yeah. And we were just kind of walking around, you know, by ourselves, of course, trying to make it look like we have the like we're secure in area.

00;36;30;08 - 00;36;48;17
Unknown
Okay. So you kind of resume that role of, of seeing all through our heads. We're going like, what the fuck just happened, guys, were you guys discussing this amongst yourselves or was everybody pretty stone cold? We were stone cold, like we nobody wanted to talk about. Was there any point that you guys discussed it with? When we got in town to Subic Bay?

00;36;48;24 - 00;37;08;24
Unknown
I only question I had asked. One of them was, are you going to say anything about this or tell your wife? And it was absolutely not. And that's literally it. And have you encouraged these fellow Marines who are with to come forward and tell their story to. No. Okay. They're not happy with me. For obvious reasons.

00;37;08;24 - 00;37;28;06
Unknown
I don't blame them. This wasn't something that you know, I tried to get one of them to help me with this to an extent. And his response, which everybody has seen publicly, was kind of the indicator that something did happen, that something was wrong. And that's for people who don't know the text that was featured in the Daily Mail article that basically says, leave me out.

00;37;28;06 - 00;37;50;03
Unknown
That was when I had members of the Senate Intelligence Committee asking me to have something to the message. One of them that I was still in contact with. Seeing if he could tell anything anonymously to them, which they already know who he is. I've already provided everybody the names to these guys among the Pentagon area. They all have that.

00;37;50;05 - 00;38;13;18
Unknown
Do you know if they've been contacted by Senate Intelligence Committee or anything? Not that I'm aware, because I'm pretty sure I would have gotten probably yelled at or fuck you or something. Yeah. So you guys get picked picked up by the 53 super stallion, returned to the USS Denver, correct. How long? What would you say the time elapsed was from the second you were in the chow hall, approached by the major to returning to the ship.

00;38;13;18 - 00;38;30;21
Unknown
Well, did you get approached by the major? When there was in the chow hall, there was other Marines that are people. I don't remember specifically how that happened. So she wasn't gathering everybody up. These were higher up. It could have been staff sergeants or sergeants or something. And so there you go. You know, you guys want to come with this or.

00;38;30;22 - 00;38;50;22
Unknown
Okay, you know, so whoever was at that point, you know, you're going to meet in the war room at this time. And I don't remember the specifics of time. I don't remember who told us. I mean, that's just that's so long ago. Yeah, but it's just able to kind of understand it wasn't anybody in my typical chain of command, which was, you know, because obviously they were kind of more the, hey, you guys are needed for this.

00;38;50;22 - 00;39;07;14
Unknown
And these were just Michigan volunteers, not hand-selected, like strong operatives or, you know, they would just randomly put us in sticks. Okay. That's all I remember them kind of organizing. You're in this deck. You guys are in this deck. So it wasn't like it was something that was very well planned. Or they based off your skill set or what?

00;39;07;16 - 00;39;25;12
Unknown
Chain of command or whatever. This one. Yeah. So like I, I think we can kind of go chronologically through like your experience in Indonesia. So like the first thing I'm wondering is like, what what is the typical day look like for you on the Denver. On the ship? Yeah. Like when you were when you were like, en route to Indonesia.

00;39;25;17 - 00;39;50;24
Unknown
Like, I know you were assigned to the officers chow. Like, what would kind of a typical day look like for you? Just like on the ship. So typically, if I can recall this accurately, I mean, because every day blends together in this. Yeah, it's just like it was like 15 years ago at this point. So, I mean, you typically would have revelry, everybody would get up, but obviously we'd get up early because we were either helping with breakfast and having to serve up that.

00;39;50;24 - 00;40;11;08
Unknown
And least you know, which there's it's not like we were just serving food because we didn't do that. We were just more, I think, trying to set stuff up, trying to clean stuffs, you know, so the cooks actually took actual good care of their job because they're working for the officers, which is great. So they want to take pride in what they do.

00;40;11;10 - 00;40;30;00
Unknown
We got to eat really good because of it. Compared to what the other guys got to eat. So that was always good. So, breakfast like a full time job like that. Yeah. Assignment was was kind of like we would report for doing officers chow and it was like a eight hour shift type of thing. Was it? Okay, sometimes they catch you, like with a break.

00;40;30;00 - 00;40;56;13
Unknown
So you could either go, which I went to the gym on ship or went back and then slept for a bit or whatever it is. So there's always things that you can do because when they ask you to work on to that, that's where you're spending your time. Yeah. So so how does it work with, you know, especially for me because like, I don't have any, you know, military experience, you know, you have like, a chain of command that you're a part of.

00;40;56;21 - 00;41;12;11
Unknown
You know, as a marine. But I know there's, you know, when you're on the ship, you've, you've described kind of like it's like a separate chain of command or like. Correct. Because what who you reporting to or like the Marines that are in charge of that part of the Marines that are on the ship with the logistics. Yeah.

00;41;12;14 - 00;41;26;25
Unknown
All they basically did was say, hey, your number has been picked. You're going to go over here while you're on the ship, which is great. Yeah. Because like I said, we got to have fun doing it. We got to eat better than everybody else, you know? So it was something that I enjoyed doing because I got eaten all the time.

00;41;26;25 - 00;41;43;10
Unknown
I got better, I got all the good stuff. We got T-Bone steaks, everybody else got the little tiny cuts, and we got full T-Bones. Yeah. So you would work, in child with people that weren't necessarily in your immediate team or platoon, just random people on the ship whose numbers were called for. Same duty. Yep. I mean, it wasn't really a number of bases.

00;41;43;10 - 00;42;18;24
Unknown
They just selected whoever, whatever, amount they needed. They ball and told us to, you know, this was what you're going to do. And typically during that, I do remember deploying at least being forward deployed to, Japan a couple weeks to, I think a month before the whole main element did, because they got us ready and we went on ship before everybody else did too, because we're obviously work in this detail, so they have to kind of read you up on things, show you how to do things, and then when the whole thing kicks off, get on the ship and everybody's just, yeah, you know.

00;42;18;24 - 00;42;37;08
Unknown
So for weeks we were on a ship with nobody else in our berthing, which was cool too. So they were trying to figure out where Marines were being assigned to, if that makes sense. Now so when you got you know, you spoke about getting briefed in the boardroom that that was where you were assigned. So how did that exactly go down.

00;42;37;08 - 00;42;55;24
Unknown
Like were you like in the middle of, you know, working in the kitchen. And then you just heard someone call out like, you know, hey, we need some volunteers. Was it I think it was that. I don't remember that part specifically. I just remember, the key things I remember who briefed us. Yeah. Which was a female major.

00;42;55;26 - 00;43;14;03
Unknown
And then they were putting up pictures of Obama when he was a kid. Senator, his family members were there. So the things that really stuck out of place that were kind of what I remember mostly now, did you you had actually brought this up earlier. Had you ever seen that woman before? Was she dressed in navy? Do you say she was in?

00;43;14;19 - 00;43;38;16
Unknown
She was in our Mar woodlands. Okay. So USMC okay. And the other people who were kind of brought to volunteer with you, were they in the mess hall with you? When the major comes in and, requesting volunteers? Yes, some of them. Well, kind of all of them, but some of them. And so at this time, like your immediate squad team leader, the other people you're with, they're doing other duties on the ship, they're doing with whatever the unit's doing.

00;43;38;20 - 00;43;57;00
Unknown
Okay, typically. So that's how that works. Now, we weren't in a combat situation, so that's why that it was a little bit different because it's more relaxed now, if this was something that was combat oriented and they really wouldn't pull us off to do anything like this because we'd be training and doing whatever we had to do with our unit.

00;43;57;06 - 00;44;13;19
Unknown
Right. Because I know there's a lot of questions about like, team leaders and so forth. So when you're on an active mission with a team leader, you'd be with them like glue. But on ships you're assigned to your actual duties, correct. And so forth. And it also kind of depends on on what details you're doing. Okay. So I mean it's not like that for everybody.

00;44;13;26 - 00;44;36;26
Unknown
There's people. Yeah. You have an acting team leader who's just a guy who fills that billet. He could be somebody else that's not in our instance was not in our platoon or squad or anything like that. So like what kind of typical like check in would you have to do with any superior while on that ship? So kind of when we would report to that, they'd obviously kind of take roll call, make sure everybody was there, and then that's pretty much it.

00;44;36;28 - 00;44;53;13
Unknown
It wasn't. I mean, because really it's not like rocket science, for example. Yeah. So you know, but it was you also reported to Navy personnel too, because they're the ones that you're typically helping in assisting the ship. Correct. So they have more kind of what you would call a higher billet at that point because it's their ship.

00;44;53;19 - 00;45;23;06
Unknown
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense because that's really helpful just from someone who's not, you know, military. That provides a lot of context. Now, so during the actual briefing that you were given about the mission that you were, about to partake on, were there other people in the wardroom during that briefing, or was it so like, there could potentially be bystanders that kind of overheard it or overheard, you know, the mission briefing, essentially.

00;45;23;14 - 00;45;49;23
Unknown
So anybody who was in there were, some key leaders, but there was also some other NCOs. There were a lot of people I didn't know. So so I was thinking, you know, could potentially be witnesses that would have, you know, seen you seen the briefing and if they remember. Yeah. I mean, I mean, right, you know, I mean, I like I said, I don't remember anybody else besides some of the guys, but I just remember the thing that stuck out was a female major because she was beautiful.

00;45;50;00 - 00;46;04;10
Unknown
Yeah. Somebody that's, you know, of course you're on a ship. You're like, man, I see a lot of women around. Yeah. So, there was that. And then obviously the whole thing with Obama, you really don't see anything like that. It's not something you're really briefed on most of the time. So I wanted to show this to you.

00;46;04;10 - 00;46;26;11
Unknown
Does this look like what that would look like? I was trying to find a picture of, like, the actual Denver. Yeah. That would that is a different ship, but it's the same, you know, the same class. Yeah. And from what I can recall, because they had a wall where the projector was hitting and that's where they were again.

00;46;26;11 - 00;46;41;21
Unknown
But that's kind of similar, at least from this view. Yeah. I mean, but then again, it looks a lot like other ward rooms that were on other ships just to get a general idea of the size it because like for me, thinking like cafeteria because a wardroom is essentially a cafeteria. Yes. Just like a smaller because obviously officers.

00;46;41;22 - 00;47;07;23
Unknown
Yeah. Correct. Yeah. So it's kind of a more small. Yeah. Intimate kind of setting. Correct. What else can you remember from this briefing? What was the mission operation directive? What was the mission time? I don't remember any of those fine details. Just because one, it's been a long time, but two, the only, the only things I can recall is literally the female major briefing us.

00;47;07;23 - 00;47;34;22
Unknown
And then, pictures of Obama when he was a kid, his parents. Just stuff that really stuck out. Yeah. And I actually found evidence of, you know, Obama, he spent a lot of time in Indonesia, when he was a child, and that's all public knowledge. So, it's interesting that they had included that. But I mean, like, just overall like in general, what was your understanding of, like, what you guys were about to go security, security, security.

00;47;34;27 - 00;47;55;11
Unknown
Yeah. Yeah, I think it was more there was there was a delivery of supplies. Yeah. We go to it to a remote village. You know, there's plenty of evidence that says that the helicopter, heavy lift helicopters, the Super Stallions on the Denver were specifically going to be tasked to go to remote villages because, you know, roads were being blocked off by you by landslides and stuff.

00;47;55;26 - 00;48;16;09
Unknown
And so you're saying security for the delivery of the. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, because what the whole point, and this isn't something that just even what that female major was saying, but it's just even the fact that everybody knows this the second largest terrorist capital in the world and very it's a very, mass Muslim dominant area, you know what I mean?

00;48;16;09 - 00;48;31;24
Unknown
So there's people that typically aren't going to be very friendly of us. And that's kind of the first concerns they were having, why they did things the way they did. I don't know, I didn't plan it. I wasn't in charge with that. So there's things that even I have. Questions are it's like, why would you do that? Yeah.

00;48;32;01 - 00;48;52;18
Unknown
And what was the protocol after the briefing? Were you immediately ordered to go to an armory locker, check out weapons and ammunition and report to the Super Stallions? So, all they told us to do was basically get. So they got all our stuff, and, we went to the armory to draw, and they already had weapons picked for us because that was a saga.

00;48;52;19 - 00;49;12;05
Unknown
Yeah. So we don't they didn't we're not using a software for this type of ordeal, you know, because it's not you're going not going into combat. So that's how I remember because I was a sore gunner, I never really was issued an M16. I first time I when I got there, I was actually issued a 2 or 3 with an M16 A4, and that was with Gulf Company.

00;49;12;07 - 00;49;33;00
Unknown
And they said that the reason why they wanted me to do that was because I was the boot. And they're looking for the people with the grenade launcher because they know it's a team leader. So meaning that the enemy is going to target you. So which I mean, it was it was cool because I'm like, I get to carry a grenade launcher, but then I like the sword because it's a belt fed automatic weapon and that I like that better.

00;49;33;02 - 00;49;58;20
Unknown
And so naturally, being used to M16, that sucked because I like having a machine gun. Yeah, I'm full auto, you know, and I eat so, you know, the whole idea of you providing security, you know, initially a lot of people would say like, oh, that's baloney. Like, no one would have weapons on a humanitarian mission because really the, the, the, the overall operation was humanitarian relief delivered.

00;49;58;20 - 00;50;37;18
Unknown
Correct. And people like, oh, you never have weapons, but I found, Rear Admiral Richard Land, old, who was the rear admiral who debriefed you after your mission on the ship? He actually did a sort of, like, a press conference briefing, and I'll just read a part of the quote here. So once the 53 guys came aboard on the morning of the 9th of October, we put them to work first, getting survey teams out to the countryside to see where would be the best locations to drop the cargo that we wanted to get there, and also to get people in place, because when these helicopters start showing up with cargo, the first concern

00;50;37;18 - 00;51;06;04
Unknown
is crowd control, you know, so you don't want people, you know, rushing the helicopters. And, another little interesting thing that kind of supports this that I found was, photographs from the ninth and the 10th of the Indonesian military, because, you know, there were there was also Indonesian military doing release, as well. And there's a picture of the helicopter and a whole bunch of locals, just, like all over the helicopter, just like mobbing.

00;51;06;04 - 00;51;28;17
Unknown
It totally makes sense that, you know, there would be, you know, a mission like that to, to provide security and not to mention we've, you know, at this point have found numerous photographs of, people of Marines doing exactly that. They had rifles and were, you know, providing security around the helicopters. Right. Well, I mean, security is needed.

00;51;28;19 - 00;51;43;25
Unknown
It's just common sense at that point, you know, as much as people would say in the military or at least in the Marine Corps, common sense is not a common virtue, but you still get to protect and have a barrier between everybody else, because second largest terrorist capital in the world, there's also desperate people who are desperate to do anything for help.

00;51;43;28 - 00;52;07;23
Unknown
And you have that combination of things that can get pretty tricky. Thankfully, we didn't have that, but thankfully, I would have rather have experienced that compared to what we did experience. Right? You know? So now, do you remember, do you remember which day you did your mission? I don't recall specifically the day. That's kind of what I'm having trouble with.

00;52;07;26 - 00;52;26;20
Unknown
I don't know if it was the ninth or the 10th. So the ship arrived. So there's a little bit of discrepancy on the exact date. And I think it comes down to the time zone of, like, whatever press organization reported it. But like, for instance, right in this, testimony from, from the rear admiral, you know, he says the ninth.

00;52;27;08 - 00;52;46;10
Unknown
So it seems like it was like early morning on the ninth or like late at night on the eighth. So was it like, do you remember it being the very first day that the ship arrived also? I mean, we never really went topside. Yeah. So I don't, you know, we're in the kitchen or. Yeah. And the wardroom or anything like that working.

00;52;46;10 - 00;53;02;21
Unknown
So I don't remember specifically where the only thing I remember is them turning the phones off because they had these phone rings that you have on ship, and they turn it off for about a couple of weeks. And, because I was going to call my dad and be like, hey, we're here, you know? But they didn't want that.

00;53;02;23 - 00;53;26;05
Unknown
So, I don't remember specifically that day. I do remember that when we were on foot, that it was had to have been somewhere in the early afternoon or probably late morning that time frame. I'm not entirely sure. I can't recall that. I wish I could, because then I can kind of pinpoint where things may have. We can coordinate it somehow.

00;53;26;07 - 00;53;42;20
Unknown
What? At what point did you realize that you weren't going to have radios? I wasn't a radio guy. So that was that was on my thing. So, like, wasn't even on your radar to, like, think, oh, do we have radios? Yeah, because I'm not used to it. I mean, they trained us on the radios, but it wasn't something that we ever really had.

00;53;42;20 - 00;54;00;12
Unknown
I mean, I wasn't a team leader or squad leader at that point, you know, so I didn't have access to that. And that wasn't a concern. My concern was just what I was dealing with. Yeah. So, I don't remember radios, you know, and the fact is, is I don't remember seeing anybody have radios. And the thing is, it's a humanitarian mission.

00;54;00;12 - 00;54;18;02
Unknown
It's not a combat operation, you know? So it's not like you're stepping out expecting to get into firefights and things like that. Yeah. Just humanitarian. So when you guys were gearing up for the mission, you just thought whoever the designated kind of squad or team leader for this operation, they would have something like that. Correct. And I think there's been a lot of confusion about these points.

00;54;18;02 - 00;54;40;08
Unknown
So this mission happened during one of your designated shifts in the chow hall with a team that was not your designated team leader. Okay. Correct. Somebody acting as a team leader, you know, so which happens, you know, in situations like this, at least this is my experience. I can't speak for everybody else, but just with what I personally dealt with, this is how it went for us.

00;54;40;11 - 00;55;21;01
Unknown
Now going back to the rifles, you know, like I said, at this point, I found so much evidence that there were definitely Marines there with rifles. However, there were a lot of photographs of guys basically just providing labor, you know, moving boxes, loading helicopters, things like that. And one thing that was interesting that I, learned from multiple platoon members that that I had reached out to and spoke, spoke to, they told me that there was like this rumor that at some of the first, Marines that flew in, had rifles and then got, like, chewed out by like an Air Force colonel and were told to, like, go back to the ship

00;55;21;01 - 00;55;41;04
Unknown
because it was like bad optics. And I'm curious, did you ever hear that rumor? I don't remember ever seeing an Air Force colonel. Yeah, I don't remember seeing Air Force Colonel, which everybody knows about that. So. But as far as an Air Force colonel, I don't. I don't understand how an Air Force colonel would have jurisdiction over that kind of operation anyway.

00;55;41;06 - 00;55;57;07
Unknown
Yeah, he wouldn't be in a role to tell Marines that they have to go back to a ship that somebody else. Yeah, I found that. I found that odd as well, but I, you know, I didn't know, you know, not not. No, I could I could understand a Navy full captain or, a marine colonel for that matter.

00;55;57;10 - 00;56;15;26
Unknown
He would have the authority to say something like that, because what you're talking about is the money and the resources to get X amount of people from ship to shore. So it's going to just it's going to cost money. It's just going to not make sense at that point. So you got on the helicopter, you flew to Torbay Airport, which it's not named that anymore.

00;56;15;26 - 00;56;33;20
Unknown
But you said that you never got off the helicopter at the airport. It was basically just, you know, we landed. And that's what I remember too. And this is kind of what I was able to provide people because we never got off right. And I can know the basically the direction of when we're flying off the ship, that we could see the ocean and you can start to see the land.

00;56;33;24 - 00;56;50;21
Unknown
So it kind of tells you somewhat the direction of where you're heading. All I remember from the airport that we landed on was that there was blue roofs. Yeah. That's the only thing I can indicate out of that. What I'm getting at is it's perfectly plausible if you guys, you know, didn't get off the helicopters, it's perfectly plausible.

00;56;50;21 - 00;57;06;26
Unknown
You could have landed there and not caused any sort of stir by walking around with rifles because you didn't get out. Get off the helicopter. Yeah, we weren't, we didn't. So because I remember that too, because we were sleeping, some of us on a helicopter. Because that's what you do, you know, you get used to in transport everywhere.

00;57;07;03 - 00;57;25;23
Unknown
We did in seven tons, Navy helicopters, all that fun stuff. So you're just like, oh, I'm just getting a ride and you can fall asleep anywhere at this point. Yeah. So, and it's boring, you know? It's not like it's anything. It's all. It's just humanitarian. You know, we're hoping at that point that there would have been something, but not in the indication of what we experienced.

00;57;25;23 - 00;57;48;27
Unknown
But, you know, something outside of that. So when we because what I do remember vaguely is when we landed on the airstrip and I remember seeing other helicopters basically trailing behind us in land, and then we were sitting there, I don't remember the time or how long we were sitting there, but I remember then us taking off. Do you know what kind of helicopters those were?

00;57;48;27 - 00;58;14;01
Unknown
Were they 53? Okay, there may have been some 46 hours to I'm not entirely sure, but I only remember, the Denver and I only remember being on a 53. I don't remember any kind of other helicopters that were on that deck. I never really spent much time topside. The only reason I bring that up is it's I'm wondering if those were the same helicopters that ended up following you guys to the lake.

00;58;14;08 - 00;58;34;09
Unknown
You know, because I know you had said that there were other helicopters because that could be paused as far as I know, the Super Stallions were only the ones that came on the Denver. Like there weren't any additional super. Yeah. I don't I don't remember, you know, I don't remember any of that. Right? I mean, there's been plenty of ships that have been on there.

00;58;34;09 - 00;59;02;05
Unknown
I remember seeing 40 sixes, which are the dual, the Egg Beaters, if you will. Right. I remember seeing plenty of those, you know, but, as far as the Denver, I don't really recall. That could have been. It could have not been. You know, I just don't know. Even if your mission happened to after the point where those guys supposedly got yelled at for bringing rifles, like, it's plausible that you could have had your mission even after that point and just slip by unnoticed because you didn't get off the helicopter.

00;59;02;07 - 00;59;28;12
Unknown
Right? You know, so the flight to the LC described the view that you have outside, the back of the helicopter. So coming from the airport, I can remember just looking at the ocean. And then we were getting I remember seeing some very heavy vegetation and kind of like, hills. Wasn't, like, flat with trees or bushes or anything.

00;59;28;12 - 00;59;50;15
Unknown
It was like getting thicker and was, I remember seeing some hills not from the hill helicopter, but because when you get off the bird, they have one area where you can't go because you have this big tail rotor and you don't want to run underneath the thing. So they always say either I think is go to the right or the left, I can't remember, but whatever the whatever side the tail rotor is not on is where you're egress in helicopter.

00;59;50;15 - 01;00;20;14
Unknown
And then basically you would form a, a 360 around the helicopter to provide that security and then it take off. And then you basically would get into a formation and you'd patrol, from there. I don't really recall when I got off the helicopter, what I really saw at that point. But I do remember seeing some hills and I remember seeing some thick vegetation, and I don't remember if I saw any villagers or other personnel or people there backing up just a step.

01;00;20;14 - 01;00;40;09
Unknown
Like when you guys were at the at the airport. Did you guys were there any supplies loaded on the helicopter? So this was strictly a personnel transport. And were there any other people on the helicopter that were being taken to the LC, or was it just it was just us. And then you have the crew chief and you have, you know, some other crew support and then the pilots, obviously.

01;00;40;12 - 01;00;59;21
Unknown
So I, I don't really recall. One crew chief was just basically walking up and down and watching everybody doing their job. I don't remember anybody else. I just remember it was just one guy, and I don't remember seeing any kind of boxes or, stuff that they would store in there. And obviously we didn't have anything on the bottom because how are you going to land at the airport when you have.

01;00;59;21 - 01;01;19;09
Unknown
All right. Yeah. If you like a, like a cargo tractor type of thing. Which some of the helicopters were transporting stuff that way. So you landed at the LC. You describe it as a hasty LC. You know, I've come to learn. That's a that's like a technical term. There's like a, there's like that. That means something very specific.

01;01;19;09 - 01;01;36;04
Unknown
Are you using it in that way or. It's what does that mean for someone who's like hasty, who's kind of like off the hip? It's not something very thought out. It's just like, okay, where can we okay. Right there. Looks good. Right? And that's maybe what they were thinking as far as the pilots are concerned, I don't know.

01;01;36;04 - 01;01;52;26
Unknown
But, maybe they had a designated. But it just seemed to me because we were kind of the first ones there, that it'd be hasty, in my opinion. But then when everything's also set up some other Marines that probably come in, we're like, okay, there's a secure that's something set up. It may not be a hasty LC at that point, but the when we approach it, I just remember not really seeing anybody there.

01;01;52;26 - 01;02;08;27
Unknown
So it's kind of like, okay, well so there was not so there weren't there wasn't anyone at TLC when you landed guys were I don't recall that there could have been some bystanders off to the off in the distance that maybe saw the attention or saw what was going on that decided to come up at a later point.

01;02;09;18 - 01;02;27;04
Unknown
But yeah, as far as arriving there, I don't remember seeing anybody. So you guys step off the 53, your primary objective is to provide security. What do you guys do? Right when you step off that? Well, we saw this opportunity to take the slope because we have visual around everything. It allows us to basically act within that protocol.

01;02;27;04 - 01;02;49;19
Unknown
Right? As being in a tactical vantage of being in an elevated position is where you want to be. And that's what you know. I wasn't the one that made the decision. The guy that was in charge of us was the one that made that decision. You know, it wasn't terribly too far in comparison. But at the same point, when you have visual of that and, you're also watching some other stuff happen.

01;02;49;22 - 01;03;18;29
Unknown
I remember losing one helicopter that actually had the cargo net on the bottom that was flown in, dropped it off, and then it banked off to the right. What I'm curious is like, what was your what was your initial impression when you got off the helicopter, like in comparison to your briefing? Like your expectations that were set by the briefing and then the reality of you getting off this helicopter and you're there, first of all, you said the helicopter left, right?

01;03;19;00 - 01;03;42;03
Unknown
Yeah. Like it dropped you guys off. It's gone. You guys have no radio. Correct. There's really no one around. You guys are the only people there. So like, can you remember, like, was there an adjustment to your expectations of, like the reality of the situation versus what you were expecting? Honestly, I thought it was more like, hey, we're not doing it with this.

01;03;42;05 - 01;04;00;28
Unknown
Yeah. It's like it's just going to be boring to standing around looking at people like, you know, and that's why I had a video camera and I was taking pictures on video because I remember getting the one helicopter that dropped off something on video, and I remember getting it and, needless to say, it wasn't at the point where we, you know, because we were conditioned three with our weapons.

01;04;00;28 - 01;04;17;18
Unknown
It wasn't like it was chambered around or nothing. We just had a magazine inserted. Safety was on, the bolt was all the way forward, weapon was unsafe, and the injection port cover was closed, as is it states in the conditional rules. Right. So I thought it was just. Oh, yeah. We're just going to be standing around.

01;04;17;18 - 01;04;40;04
Unknown
This is just going to be kind of boring. You know, even trying to help out with boxes or something probably would have been more helpful in comparison here because you're actually doing something right. So, you know, that lines up perfect. Like what every single person I've talked to who was on this operation, you know, doing different missions, on the operation, described the same situation where they felt it was like boring.

01;04;40;04 - 01;05;01;07
Unknown
It was like an excuse to get off the ship. Yep. You know, obviously you're doing a good deed, and you and, you know, it's it's a good experience from that perspective. But it's interesting to hear that because I think a lot of people have this misconception that this was like, you know, because you had mentioned that, you know, you were notified there were terrorists in the in the location that you guys were like, super on alert.

01;05;01;07 - 01;05;25;04
Unknown
Like this was like you were ready to engage an enemy and, you know, that sort of thing. Nothing like that. Were you surprised when the helicopter took off? Yeah. Okay. And did you have any sort of estimated timeframe when it was to return to the mission duration? I have no clue. Okay. That you guys, or I suppose the squad leader decided that you guys should go up to the top of the hill, right?

01;05;25;07 - 01;05;42;07
Unknown
Can you know what? It makes sense because we were out in the open, and you don't necessarily want to be out in the open if you've got no support at that. And so where we were at was kind of hidden and you kind of get in the vegetation a little bit more. So I can kind of understand why he would say, let's go ahead and push up this direction.

01;05;42;07 - 01;06;07;18
Unknown
Now you've mentioned, a second helicopter flying in. You had your camera, you know, you took some pictures of that helicopter coming in, but did you? I almost remember you saying that it it didn't fly to the same landing point that your helicopter did. It landed somewhere off in the distance. Yeah, a little bit further away. So that makes me wonder kind of how big was the LC essentially?

01;06;07;18 - 01;06;30;24
Unknown
Like was it was kind of just like an open area. Was it just like a. No no, it was it was pretty low. I remember it kind of being open, but that's where I remember the hills and stuff, because it was like an open area with thick, tall grass. Right. And it was kind of, well, I would assume muddy because it's, tropical terrain obviously wasn't like we were on a dirt road or something that was already, you know, cleared out to be used as transportation.

01;06;30;27 - 01;06;48;26
Unknown
So I think it was just more in a sense that there's a clear area over here. And obviously there was they probably the second helicopter probably saw other people that were probably close to that area. I assume that those are the people for us. We were off in the distance. So whether or not he could see us at that point, I don't know, I assume he wouldn't be able to.

01;06;48;26 - 01;07;06;20
Unknown
But because where we were at, I mean, there's trees, you know? Yeah. So you didn't see any sort of like, preparation to the LC? Yeah. Like they didn't cut down trees ahead of time. You didn't see any red tape because I've seen some photographs of other losses that, you know, showed like red tape kind of closing off the area.

01;07;06;20 - 01;07;20;08
Unknown
Yeah. I don't remember any red tape or seeing that kind of stuff. So. Right. So, so what would you estimate the time elapsed was from the second you left the chow hall to returning to the Denver? I, we know a couple hours. Okay. Had it been a couple but not like a full day. No, it was not a full day.

01;07;20;08 - 01;07;42;12
Unknown
Had it been a couple hours, there was nothing, something that could have taken place within the span of a chow hall shift. Like the time you need more than that to. Okay. You know, because it had to be a couple hours, man. You know, it wasn't wasn't like an all day thing. Okay, thankfully, you know what I forgot to ask is the what was the weather like at the like sunny.

01;07;42;14 - 01;07;56;22
Unknown
Yeah. Yeah. Sunny I remember, I remember because it was hot. I mean it was hot regardless I guess if even if there was cloud cover I still would be hot because it's tropical. I don't remember really.

01;07;56;25 - 01;08;13;23
Unknown
I don't remember actually looking up the sky to see if there were clouds or if it was sunny. I just remember it being hot, assuming it was sunny. And so when you get back to the Denver, how does it work? Like, you know, you have your rifle, you have to, like, go back to the armory or something.

01;08;13;23 - 01;08;45;10
Unknown
We dropped everything off there. Given the magazines. Was it my magazines? It was somebody else's. What do you mean by that? So there's the armor that gave us those magazines that were full because you were sore. So you had your own weapon assigned? Yep. I had my own magazines, but, next, I remember if I actually had those on my vest, too, or if I had a left arm locked up or, in a typically had those of my assault pack, which I didn't bring an assault pack with me trying to remember.

01;08;45;12 - 01;09;14;11

Yeah. With somebody else's magazines, insurance. I was a because this was a loaner M16 loaner magazines from us assigned to a different soldier. Right. People compare you to, like, the, like the Dodie and Pedowitz story. And I'm like, that's completely different because benefits didn't have this, like a undeniable no experience where he saw an antenna retract. He had radio communication that was alien communications, and he speculated that it could be it, you know, just egged that on.

01;09;14;12 - 01;09;42;28
Unknown
Correct? Yeah. This is totally and this is coming from Dodie himself. I asked him kind of what that whole thing was. Yeah. I said, yeah. Well, somebody said they heard something. Paul. And this is what I was told to do, right? That's what they said. So I mean, like, it makes it just logically makes no sense. Like if you were making this up, if the if a disinfo agent were to come and like, be like, yeah, I know about your, your operation that you stumbled upon, it's like if you made it up, you would know that he's like, well, exactly.

01;09;42;28 - 01;10;02;08
Unknown
Because how could he tell you that he was exactly know like, it just doesn't make any sense. No. I mean, I wish it was made up because then I wouldn't have to have been going through losing my fucking hair and having, you know, sleepless nights and literally just it I wouldn't be in the uncomfortable position I would be in.

01;10;02;11 - 01;10;23;02
Unknown
Yeah. And it's not fun being in this position. It really is. And that's why I tell people especially, I'm not encouraging my guys to come forward. Now, let's say at the same blows, hope. And then all of a sudden everything is able to be proven true. And let's just say these insiders at some point ever do or some information comes out that's physical, that literally no shit can prove everything.

01;10;23;02 - 01;10;42;06
Unknown
Then maybe they would I don't know. Yeah. But it put them in a different position. But right now, I mean even for myself, they know that I'm uncomfortable and they kind of like, well, it's your fucking fault. I don't blame them. I mean, but if I didn't see what I saw and somebody else from a different perspective was telling this story, I don't know how I would react to that.

01;10;42;06 - 01;11;00;21
Unknown
Probably. I probably wouldn't believe it. I'd probably be. But that's the only thing is, before any of this happened, I was not somebody who believed in that shit. I was somebody who was like, okay, well this guy's out of his fucking mind or you know, oh, you got you. So you're let me guess, you're in Mississippi and you're fishing and you saw a fucking craft and you saw fucking Grace.

01;11;00;21 - 01;11;20;01
Unknown
Okay. What episode of X-Files are you talking about? That's how I would think of them. But then having my experience is just like, if I experienced this, okay, maybe there might be some validity to what they're saying. I don't know, I wasn't there, but I know based off of being in my shoes, it's like it's hard to say somebody else's is not true.

01;11;20;01 - 01;11;39;18
Unknown
Or they're trying to point out the flaws or anything like that. I know what it's like to be in somebody's shoes like that. Granted, I didn't see it use I saw operators and I saw it was clearly man made and it was didn't do shit a normal helicopter or a plane did. I could tell you that. Right? I mean, it's like an unmistakable 100% right.

01;11;39;18 - 01;11;56;26
Unknown
It's like 100% something you saw at a distance. I was like, oh, that looks weird. Like this thing's right here. Yep. You see it? It's huge when close enough to hear it. Yeah. You know, that's that's kind of saw it fly off. Yep. I mean it's like didn't have a rotor. It wasn't like a helicopter. It wasn't a plane.

01;11;56;28 - 01;12;19;09
Unknown
Yeah. There's no rotor wash on the vegetation. Nothing like that. It was like it was like it was isolated in itself. Like it didn't disturb any of the environment. There's a weirdest thing I've ever seen. And I wanted to be a fighter pilot. And I knew pretty much what kind of aircraft we had at our disposal as a as a marine Corps and especially the Air Force only has a certain amount of planes are using helicopters.

01;12;19;09 - 01;12;54;28
Unknown
Same thing. There's only so many. This obviously was an Indonesian military equipment, and I don't remember any of anybody come in saying, hey, yeah. And the Indonesian military has something this sophisticated or Chinese or Japanese or for, for that matter. Right. You know, yeah, I find, I find it interesting to, you know, you testified to arrow in like, I noticed in the historical report, you know, they they emphasize like belief in, like, you know, basically trying to see, you know, people might believe what they saw or anything, but we can't prove that they're lying.

01;12;54;28 - 01;13;16;22
Unknown
And I'm like, what you're describing is, is an unmistakable testimony. There's no it's not like you could say like, oh, well, maybe he believes that's what he saw, but maybe it was something different. I know what I say, it was right. Some I mean, if anybody was to have seen this, they would remember this for the rest of their life.

01;13;16;22 - 01;13;38;25
Unknown
Exactly. It's so distinct because this never happens. Right? It's I mean, in some ways, people think I stumble on the gold. No, it's really not. But in some cases of saying that, yes, we have this technology because there's human involvement, obviously it's not like there's an ETS in there floating, flying in this damn thing, and there's just operators who just choose to be there.

01;13;38;27 - 01;14;02;23
Unknown
I mean, it's completely man made and with the human involvement, just tells me, okay, well, manmade human involvement means it's some group has it. Now I know who it is to an extent. And speaking of air, I really wanted to kind of fast forward to when you talked to him in April of 2023. What was that like? Well, like an interrogation to an extent.

01;14;02;23 - 01;14;22;21
Unknown
And so you spoke directly to Doctor Sean Kirkpatrick, right? He's the only one that I can confirm that. Yes, I talked to I know the other gentleman, but what I signed, stating that I was not allowed to divulge where we met at or who was also there. But Doctor Kirkpatrick was in the interview, and I think he was in everybody's interview.

01;14;22;21 - 01;14;41;04
Unknown
I'll have to ask other whistleblowers. I personally know if he was sitting in there with them, but he was there. What was his demeanor like when you were speaking to him? Not really interested. Everybody else was taking notes. He was more interested in the fact of, because they only ask three questions, and the three questions were all the same.

01;14;41;07 - 01;15;03;26
Unknown
It was who were these operators? I already stated once, I don't know, I'm not going to know the second time. I'm not going to know the third time. I know a little bit now of who what group they're a part of and what their backgrounds may be, but I don't know who they directly are. You. And if it was any of the people that I've been talking and working with, I would remember who they are based off their faces.

01;15;04;02 - 01;15;20;20
Unknown
And none of them are those guys. When you testified to him, did Doctor Kirkpatrick say he'd follow up? Did he say what was going to happen next, though? We'll follow up on it. You know, they wanted, because I had asked them if they could get the satellite imagery of that day and they said they had access to that.

01;15;20;22 - 01;15;41;19
Unknown
It's been more than a year, and they have yet to have anybody contact me from arrow saying that, yes, we have the imagery. Where can you point out? Because I mean, compared to 14, 15 years ago, it's going to look different. Maybe they expanded the city. There's things that vegetation have grown. There's any numerous things that could have happened between at that point to now.

01;15;41;21 - 01;16;03;28
Unknown
And how did you feel when the historical report, volume one came out? That was a a complete misprint lie of your testimony stating you saw it was a collapse for you'll be okay. I didn't say extraterrestrial, and I didn't say they were U.S Special Forces. None of that came out of my mouth. And you got to think that that's a purposeful omission to to to say those things because that's blatantly false.

01;16;03;29 - 01;16;23;06
Unknown
Correct. I've stated in every single interview and even the National Press Club, and even with some gentleman that I'm still in touch with who was in the skiff with me, he, for one knows I never said anything like that because he was sitting right here when I was talking to Kirkpatrick, among others. So I was I was pretty upset at the fact.

01;16;23;06 - 01;16;42;24
Unknown
But he can't really be upset because you already kind of expected them to do something like this. I mean, that's just what they do, was their eye, because I think some of the people who testified to arrow, there was a written memorandum for record of their testimony. Do you know if there was any written record of. I don't remember that either.

01;16;42;24 - 01;17;02;24
Unknown
I remember them taking notes and handwriting everything that you're trying to get through. But I think it was something that, like the witness had, would sign, you know, they would read over like, okay, yeah, this is what I my testimony, they would sign it for record to be like, this is my testimony that I provided to arrow. I signed I signed several documents that could have been one of them.

01;17;02;24 - 01;17;23;17
Unknown
I don't recall that. I remember I remember saying a non-disclosure saying that I would not talk about who specifically was there besides Doctor Corey admitting that he was in our interviews. So that's easy. The other gentleman, I can't. And then, the location, I can't talk about that. That's legal binding because it's not anything illegal. So I have to respect that.

01;17;23;20 - 01;17;48;12
Unknown
Yeah. What other memorandums have you seen for the arrow? Because I've only seen, Eric Tapers, who of course, is a second hand kind of. Well, think there was. I think there was something that was, for your release. Okay. From the black vault that I had recognized. Was. Was what? I provided you a direct, It was the same exact form that you had shown me.

01;17;48;14 - 01;18;04;15
Unknown
Yep. So I would recognize that. And that was provided for me to look over before. Christ. That wasn't like the actual one you signed, but it was kind of a. Yeah, because there were screenshots of this gentleman cell phone that he sent me. Who's involved with that? Did you watch his, interviews with Steven Greenstreet? It'll just Pierce.

01;18;04;15 - 01;18;23;12
Unknown
I don't watch any of his shit, dude, because I just know it's all bull fucking lies. There was a supposed to be a second piece that, completely got moved. And, you know what would get people's views if they. Hey, Sean, go ahead and come on this podcast. Here's the whistleblowers. Hey, buddy. How's it going? I haven't seen in a while.

01;18;23;13 - 01;18;42;23
Unknown
Thanks for being a fucking dick. He would he would never. He said he was. He knows. Because guess what? I can contradict the shit that he's talking about. He's so can other people. He said he wouldn't do any more media appearances after getting caught at a 2018 Skinwalker Ranch briefing. He's live. It wasn't that well. Brandon actually had posted that because he did the same thing.

01;18;42;23 - 01;19;07;03
Unknown
I didn't talk to him about this. I wasn't at this meeting and then buried it. Just post the picture on Twitter. I remember I hit Brandon up at that point. Yeah. One thing I actually kind of find funny is, you know, so neat. So Nathan came forward, you know, he your team leader, claims that, you know, you're making this all up.

01;19;07;25 - 01;19;29;10
Unknown
You know, first of all, it's like, so he, you know, he was, vetted with with Patrick in it was framed as if he was in a position like, there's no situation where Nathan would have seen the UFO, because, you know, from your testimony, he wasn't part of your squad. No, he was that that was there. No.

01;19;29;11 - 01;19;48;13
Unknown
So he wouldn't have seen the UFO, right? Not at all. Yeah. So for him to be like, yeah, we were on this mission, but we didn't see the UFO doesn't make sense, because whatever mission he did, obviously he didn't see the UFO because no, that wasn't on the same one you were. Not exactly. Nor was this a secret night mission.

01;19;48;13 - 01;20;11;09
Unknown
No, it was not. Nor. And it did not involve aliens. I mean, not at all. I never spoke seeing ETS guys. Now, that's kind of why this boring in comparison to other people's stuff, you know? But no, it was not a night mission I would accept. Have been our night. We didn't have night vision with us. You know, I had my Kevlar and I didn't even have a rhino mount to mount anything because I always kept that off because it just get in the way during the daytime.

01;20;11;11 - 01;20;15;17
Unknown
And typically I had.

01;20;15;19 - 01;20;39;25
Unknown
On my Kevlar, I usually had, goggles that were clear lenses. Most of the time it's just easy to pop those off and put them on just because, you know, I don't like having darks because it just really fucked with my vision and just I hated it. And not only that, but these were s, and they fogged up like you wouldn't believe.

01;20;39;25 - 01;21;02;01
Unknown
So at least clears are easier to deal with that as opposed to the dark lenses. But yeah, Nathan wasn't with me. Yeah, I mean wasn't. So like one thing that I find kind of funny, like when you think about it, you know, if if, you know, he's saying you made this all up. And so if that's the case, it means not only did you decide to make up a story about UFOs, but you decided the actual mission.

01;21;02;01 - 01;21;23;26
Unknown
I went on with Nathan. I'm going to pretend that didn't happen to, which makes no sense whatsoever. And I mean, really, the the only thing, that makes Nathan's testimony have any weight whatsoever is simply the fact that you're denying that you were ever on a mission with it, because you could very easily have just said, yeah, I did two missions.

01;21;23;26 - 01;21;40;08
Unknown
I did one with him, and I had this, yeah, I didn't do two. So it's like, it's just like anyone with half a brain would like, know that, you know, if you were making this all up, just say, yeah, well, I went on this real mission with Nathan. Well, yeah, you could have easily said something like that if that was really the case.

01;21;40;11 - 01;21;55;27
Unknown
Yeah, if I wanted to lie about. Right, right. But, you know, then obviously the insiders wouldn't exist. And, you know, well, that's the biggest thing for me is like, why would this insider be approaching? And it's just that one guy. It's multiple, you know what I mean? So why would they spend any time to try to help me?

01;21;55;27 - 01;22;19;00
Unknown
If I was lying to anybody, why would they expose themselves and their parts of it and details that I personally know they wouldn't take that chance. They're already their butts already puckered up just like mine compared, because obviously what they're having to deal with personally, they wouldn't subject themselves to to going to somebody who's lying doesn't make any sense.

01;22;19;03 - 01;22;41;07
Unknown
But so, Nathan, the thing that's most compelling about Nathan is, you know, he is who he says he is. Correct. You know, he was your team leader at one point. And he was on that operation. He was on the ship. All of that stuff logically lines up. And he has this photograph of two people on, on a helicopter.

01;22;41;12 - 01;23;04;19
Unknown
He says one of them is you. You deny that? Correct? I know who it is. I'm not going to say who it is, but I know who it is. Yeah. So the thing, the thing that's interesting, though, is someone found a match in the camouflage, between that photo and another photo of you. So the Daily Mail photo.

01;23;05;04 - 01;23;21;16
Unknown
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Because there's only two photos that I know that I've, that have been released. One of them was one I sent to Josh Bosworth with, Daily Mail because they're like, hey, do you have any pictures you want to. Yeah, I believe it's you. Helmet on, holding the saw. Right? Correct. So yes. And, I mean, but here's the thing.

01;23;21;16 - 01;23;43;24
Unknown
It's a medium rack that I was wearing. A lot of them are the same patterns of that way. It's not like it's a fingerprint of one specific thing. I mean, it's it's odd that it's in the same location, like, I know, like some of the patterns repeat. And you can find examples of this, all over of, of finding like the pattern, you know, on a leg here and then on a different uniform, like it'll be on like the other leg or.

01;23;43;26 - 01;24;02;29
Unknown
Right. And, but it's like some of the patterns don't even look identical, just in my opinion. You know, that's just where we're at. And so you don't think there's any possible that like, it was, it was a picture of you on a different day. No, that was not me. It just simply facial structure doesn't look the same as mine.

01;24;02;29 - 01;24;23;16
Unknown
Nothing. It's not even me. I mean, even everybody I've showed that knows me is like. That's not fucking you, dude. Yeah, I've had people text me like this guy saying, that's you. That's not you. Yeah. So I mean, if that's what he's guy, that's what he's got. That's not me. Right? What his intention with this is I don't know, but there's just I mean, you guys have a history.

01;24;23;16 - 01;24;41;22
Unknown
I mean, oh, he doesn't like me flat out, and the feeling's mutual. But the thing is, I mean, I got with what I'm dealing with in my life, and that's all I'm focused on, right? I'm not making money off of this stuff. This doesn't get me anywhere financially. What it does provide is understanding and stuff that I wish I never learned, but the truth had to be known.

01;24;41;22 - 01;25;02;25
Unknown
And I'm thankful. At least these insiders were able to show details and share me details as well of, of what they were personally dealing with. Because these guys are are working in that organization. Yeah. So let's let's fast forward to that, you know, kind of modern day, after after your, your whole experience, you don't talk about this for many years.

01;25;02;27 - 01;25;28;26
Unknown
What, what motivated you to come forward and because because you signed an NDA that basically I did in your life. Correct. All of all of us did sign that. So what motivated you to come forward? What was your objective? Well, I just instituted about I don't think that this sentence should be secret, and I don't think people should be dying and being threatened about it.

01;25;29;02 - 01;25;52;25
Unknown
Is your craft or anything. It just sounds ridiculous to me. So my motivation was, you know what? Somebody else out there besides the guys I was with and myself have had to have a similar experiences. And maybe, maybe there's a chance in hell that mine connects the dots for something. Maybe my story can help other people to an extent.

01;25;52;28 - 01;26;08;21
Unknown
As crazy as it sounds. And don't get me wrong, I agree that it's absolutely sounds fucking nuts, but they're not in my shoes and I wish some people were because I'd be like, you guys would just shut up. You guys would stay quiet. You guys were like, oh, that's not cool to talk about. I don't enjoy talking about it.

01;26;08;23 - 01;26;37;26
Unknown
But that was kind of my, my intention was maybe that this could help paint a picture or contribute in some way, shape or form. Yeah. And I think, you know, there were there were whistleblower protections that had recently been been passed. Yes. And I think I remember you talking about that, kind of being part of your motivation, like, yeah, now that they have a safety net, to an extent, making the NDAA illegal, you know, so obviously I haven't had any ramifications of that.

01;26;37;28 - 01;26;58;11
Unknown
Yeah. So it's not like I mean, I've had harassment, but you know, and the harassment served as more of like, okay, well obviously I'm pissing the right people off. Right. You know, so if I again, I have documentation of all the harassment that I've talked to them with multiple people who know what's going on. If I was making any of this up, there wouldn't be this harassment.

01;26;58;11 - 01;27;25;29
Unknown
There wouldn't be these insiders, there wouldn't be this. I wouldn't have a leg to stand on with, with other facts. And now there are facts in my world that somebody else observing outside of my circle, they may say, okay, in their world it may not be facts, but for me and my world, it is when I first connected with you, after my initial Reddit post, kind of just researching the military side of the operation and like realizing that, you know, everything you said to a letter was accurate.

01;27;26;04 - 01;27;47;05
Unknown
Yes. Regarding the kind of surrounding circumstances. And I was like, okay, well, what's next? You know, and so we, you know, I reached out, we connected. If I'm honest, I actually grew more skeptical. Yep. As far as anybody. Yes. Because you all of a sudden started talking about this insider and I'm like, this is weird.

01;27;47;05 - 01;28;03;02
Unknown
Like, what if I didn't have answers, right? You would have this experience. And now all of a sudden, someone is telling you that they know what you saw and they want to meet with you. So, you know, I didn't have anybody else that I was talking to with this. I don't I don't have a lot of friends. I don't care to have a lot of friends.

01;28;03;02 - 01;28;18;03
Unknown
I got a lot of acquaintances, like a lot of people know who I am to an extent. My what is this business? And that's what I, you know, I separate this from business because business is what my livelihood and my employees are. That's what I care about. As well as the disclosure of wanting the truth to come out.

01;28;18;10 - 01;28;42;25
Unknown
So I it's not like I had anybody else to say, hey. And then when I saw what you were doing and I saw the attention to detail and everything that you were piecing together, that kind of put something in my mind to say, you know what? Maybe this guy can help me out to an extent. Maybe, there's things that he could probably pinpoint or connect the dots on, and just your attention to detail was just something I was like, you know what?

01;28;43;01 - 01;29;00;17
Unknown
This guy's got his shit together. Maybe I'm able to provide information to you that because you seem like you you're well versed in this. I'm not. I know what I experienced, and there's other things I'm now learning. Especially with your guys's help. Especially pinpoint out to me things that I can pass on to other people and say yay or nay.

01;29;00;17 - 01;29;18;19
Unknown
Is this have any legitimacy to it? So, yeah, I was surprised at the amount of trust that you kind of put into me right away because like, if you had if you had like told stuff to the wrong person, you could have been. But I had a good chance of reading you and kind of gauging you, which is why we had a phone call.

01;29;18;20 - 01;29;38;02
Unknown
Yeah, I actually had an the biggest the, the, the, the most craziest, biggest moment for me was, you know, you were talking about this insider who wanted to meet with you. I was so skeptical. It sounds so crazy, but like, I had nothing to lose. It wasn't like I was this podcast or who, like, had to report on the story.

01;29;38;08 - 01;29;56;07
Unknown
Like I could back away from the whole thing if I'm correct, if it fell apart and I felt sketchy about it. But I was like, you know what? Let's just see what happens. We had a phone call the day before I recorded that. Yes, you got your knowledge and I oh, I was freaked out. You were I, I fucked up, I was, you know, because these guys could have done anything.

01;29;56;07 - 01;30;12;24
Unknown
I was going to their back. You. I wanted to scream at you and like say dude, don't go. I know, like, I had to, I had to I had to learn the truth. And that's what they were offering. They were offering money. They weren't offering anything like that. They were offering a chance to set me and set the record straight of what I witnessed.

01;30;12;26 - 01;30;41;02
Unknown
And I think after keeping this, you know, quiet for 14 plus years, I think I deserve the truth. I think everybody deserves the truth because for what's going on is absolute bullshit of why it's secret and why these guys feel in the right mind that they want to kidnap people or offer, them, a way out of their situation and use them as a biological equipment in these programs.

01;30;41;02 - 01;31;01;19

It's just it doesn't sit well with me. I understand why, but I think if there was some kind of government intervention with this, that there may be people that want to volunteer, maybe see what they can do and if they can, and that's their thing. And I understand that these guys are also doing the same thing, but I think they're giving false promises.

01;31;01;21 - 01;31;18;28
Unknown
I think they're being misled like they are, because that's why they're partaking in this. And they don't understand the magnitude, magnitude of what they're doing. And from my current knowledge, I know that a lot of them don't know what they're getting involved with because they're heavily drugged and they can't recall what they're doing specifically with what they're making contact with.

01;31;19;01 - 01;31;49;10
Unknown
Yeah. I wanted to ask you about this. So it was during the Npcc. You learned that these crates were in trafficking drugs. But but people I, so I did a two day event prior to that. It was June 10th, 11th and 12th. Was it the 12th of the Npcc was on? Yeah. I think the Daily Mail article came out the 10th or 11th and the NPC was out, the 12th because I was I had talked to Josh Boswell with Daily Mail prior to going to DC.

01;31;49;24 - 01;32;14;23
Unknown
And, and Greer was the one that set all that up. And my goal, as much as I possibly can, is having some transparency, because I think that's important. And as uncomfortable it is for me to be public, I don't enjoy it, but if I'm able to provide any, any kind of asset to disclosure in any kind of way, I'm not here for money.

01;32;14;26 - 01;32;33;09
Unknown
Everybody knows that I seem good because I'm not for that, cause that's I make my own money. As you guys know, you guys seem so, And it's even crazy that I got employees that don't know what I'm doing, and I don't talk. I don't talk about it freely. There's some people who do, and they're kind of curious, and they just, like, kind of find out on their own or.

01;32;33;09 - 01;32;49;24
Unknown
Yeah, other people. Oh yeah, it's good. It's been some people talk and. Yeah. So I assume that some people don't know because nobody asks me. Some people have seen what I did and they're texting me, man, that's you know, you kind of try to get in detail with it. I'm like, I can't tell you much, man. Yeah. You know this, you know.

01;32;49;26 - 01;33;16;09
Unknown
Yeah. Just jumping back to I just wanted to emphasize that the biggest moment for me and you actually at this point, you're kind of like, totally read into all of that. Yes. Yes. So like that meeting you had with the insider was the pivotal moment for me because that conversation that you and I had prior to the day before that meeting gave me very specific starting point.

01;33;16;16 - 01;33;40;10
Unknown
Yes. To be able to track the helicopter. I knew the location where you guys were meeting, and it just it set up, a way for me to verify a lot of things because there was an important piece of evidence. And so that is what led me to to verify on your on a court to verify without you even knowing.

01;33;40;10 - 01;34;00;02
Unknown
Correct where you went. I was really surprised when you told me. Yeah. I was like, yeah, how the fuck did you find that? Yeah, I was like, okay, now the yeah, I it's obvious after that point. Yeah. And I think it was, I think it was a good slip up to an extent because, because it was able to at least pinpoint somebody to be able to verify.

01;34;00;04 - 01;34;20;21
Unknown
Because with that helicopter flight, your as well as I was able to provide other events that were going on. Yeah, that was the other thing because like prior to me revealing to you that I like tracked it on radar, I was like, hey, do you remember what time you took off? And you told me, and it was exactly what the radar said.

01;34;20;28 - 01;34;48;13
Unknown
I was like, Holy crap. And then, yeah, there were some kind of, limited time kind of events that were happening on the ground that could be visible from the air. Yep. And and you corroborated that? Yes. I was able to cross-check that with, you know, local news, and like, I've spoken to you about how I authenticated the evidence and used.

01;34;48;13 - 01;35;04;19
Unknown
Yes. You know, and the only thing I can say without going into specifics is, you know, where I went. Yeah. That's all that's all we're going to talk about it. Yeah. Yeah. But and and I know, you know now because I say he's provided we know for okay that because I think some people should know I trust you guys.

01;35;04;20 - 01;35;23;05
Unknown
Yeah I am you've been by my side for a year without finally meeting you today. No, no it's it's still crazy. Yes, but you're, I can tell because I read people very well. That's where sales comes into. I can kind of gauge, you know, and, I, I know that you're for the truth, and I know you are, too.

01;35;23;05 - 01;35;49;23
Unknown
And I am as well. And we're all in the same shoes as far as wanting this to come forward and wanting this whole thing to stop, because our way of life can improve. You know, the insider provided a lot of, information for you to disseminate. Yes. And granted, it was tough for me because that, you know, they were in attendance and it was a group of they not pronounced attendance in the, Npcc 2023.

01;35;49;24 - 01;36;09;06
Unknown
They were there, but they were also there at the other events, the one three days before, it was two days. So it was a 10th, 11th and 12th. Okay. So it was during was that on a Monday, the Npcc? I let me look real. Okay. So you were talking about just a couple days before the Npcc, that's when you first kind of met these insiders.

01;36;09;06 - 01;36;36;27
Unknown
So I didn't meet them directly. But I know that they were in attendance and, when I had presented on that Saturday, I believe is when it was, Saturday and Sunday. Yeah, I think it was the Saturday and Sunday because I got in Friday afternoon or morning. And then they went to the hotel. I had dinner with Korea and everybody, kind of met them, actually, it was a couple drinks.

01;36;38;13 - 01;36;56;16
Unknown
At the hotel. And then we got our rooms, got everything situated, went downstairs. I introduced my wife to everybody to that I've already been kind of somewhat familiar with and talking to, and it was my first time in meeting some people, like Michael Stratton person Doctor Greer in person, or would be the second time because he was here in Boulder.

01;36;56;26 - 01;37;16;29
Unknown
That's when I first actually met him. And that was in 2017. And I was, I just kind of felt that he was somebody at the time who was talking about this, and there were some things that he had hinted that were may have been maybe other people have experienced what I've experienced. And he was talking to.

01;37;16;29 - 01;37;38;11
Unknown
So I wanted to tell him, hey, this was my situation. You know, anybody else who went through this? Maybe it's something I can convey and compare notes to this person. And of course they don't. Some of them are dead and some of them refuse to talk. Understandably. But, yes, these insiders were there. So when I had did that event, and it may be on YouTube, I can't find it anywhere.

01;37;38;14 - 01;38;13;06
Unknown
It may be on YouTube or some, because I know it was recorded because Doctor Greer and myself were kind of frustrated that their audio and video people were kind of slack and, I had given my piece that day and I had, expressed that what I hypothesized was drugs. Right. And that's when Doctor Greer pulled me aside and showed me his phone that had a text message from this individual that had he had this encrypted app, it was not signal was some other high tech communication platform, did not look like signal.

01;38;13;09 - 01;38;33;27
Unknown
And I read the text message and what that text message said was, and my wife was actually sitting on the couch in the in the green room, and I was close to her, and Doctor Greer was standing to my right. And the text message said, I don't want to leave my girl hanging, but I know what Michael saw.

01;38;33;29 - 01;38;53;20
Unknown
And he went through this whole he wrote a Bible, essentially, of what it was to an extent, but he had talked that he wanted to now talk to Doctor Greer privately and discuss what it was. And, so I at that point, because I was, I was volunteered security for him, which is what I'm doing with this too.

01;38;53;20 - 01;39;09;06
Unknown
But it's more of me to kind of see what the fuck else is going on. This is how I can get information. So you do it. You you help benefit somebody, but you also get to kind of learn more in depth of what's kind of been going on. And you get to be in the sensitive meetings and stuff and kind of really see.

01;39;09;10 - 01;39;31;05
Unknown
So it's kind of my personal way to kind of disseminate information and maybe be able to understand. That's just my curiosity. But, I met the gentleman, which, of course, he didn't know that I knew who he was to an extent, because Greer said he was going to meet with him and maybe they were going to put me in a green room and have a face to face conversation, which never happened.

01;39;31;07 - 01;39;59;08
Unknown
And then I wake up to, text message that he sent me at 2:00 in the morning. I don't remember what day specifically. I still have it because I have it all saved. Of course, just in case I have a paper trail. Just in case anything happens. And, He had said that, the gentleman's name, to an extent, knows what I saw and would like to talk to me about it.

01;39;59;10 - 01;40;21;22
Unknown
And he is the NOC, non-official covers what that stands for in a CIA term. And he gave me his phone number, which is one of one of many ways that number. So I, I, I was like, oh, shit. Okay. And it wasn't like I wasn't expecting it because I was like, okay, this guy probably he probably won't bother with me.

01;40;21;23 - 01;40;41;15
Unknown
He'll just tell Doctor Greer everything, and then Doctor Vera will tell me what I dealt with and experience. But that wasn't the case. So, I had I sat on it for probably about a day or two because I was like, okay, here's a point of no return. Realistically. And then I was like, you know what? Fuck it.

01;40;41;18 - 01;40;59;25
Unknown
So you're you're referring to he he wanted to meet with you. Well, he was the message. He wasn't know. So the message I sent him was Doctor Greer providing me his contact info. Gotcha. Okay, so that's what I sat on. And, so I was just thinking every scenario in my head, like, oh, fuck. What? What am I going to.

01;40;59;28 - 01;41;19;04
Unknown
What is this doing? Am I getting set up? Was part of that, too? I mean, it's a percentage, sure, because I'm nervous. And, you know, I've already kind of said my piece. I'm nervous now. The whole world knows what I disclosed. And it was very uncomfortable. I hate fucking being public, but it's just it's something that needs to be done.

01;41;20;11 - 01;41;42;08
Unknown
And he had I called him and he did not answer any that not a voicemail said so then I texted him and they responded immediately. And I have it, I have the text messages and basically what he said that he he's going to fly me out somewhere and he was going to be able to provide me documentation, among other things, that will help me with this.

01;41;42;08 - 01;42;05;19
Unknown
But now that I came forward, they these guys were working in that organization that I witnessed that during this operation. He had some insight to tell me, and that's what we did. We met up and you had the phone call of that, and you have some details about where I met, this gentleman, particularly and, where he flew me off to to provide me more information.

01;42;05;19 - 01;42;33;04
Unknown
Why do you feel like he wanted to meet you in person versus just talking to you on the phone call, that sort of thing. Like, what was that? I think it was establishing trust. It's easy to talk to people over the phone, getting face to face with people and having them tell you things. Now, granted, when he and I met and we were sitting across from each other and I've said this in multiple interviews, but I had my phone off because he had had this one that can detect any chips.

01;42;33;04 - 01;42;56;05
Unknown
And I showed you the text message or the message that he sent me talking about why they did that and, which they're all chipped. So, that's all I'm going to say about that. But I guess it was a chance to get the truth. And I can tell when he was talking to me that he was very fidgety and very nervous because he doesn't know who I am and I don't know who he is.

01;42;56;05 - 01;43;15;26
Unknown
So him being nervous. But he looked through my background. He looked at every possible detail about me. So he knew everything. So I know that he knew that wasn't some asset planted and trying to fish people out, which I know is a concern of theirs, which is why they're screening people heavily and do what they do. So, which I was just as nervous.

01;43;15;26 - 01;43;41;18
Unknown
And that's when he, during that interview or, meet up the meeting, that's when he provided me insight on as a way to establish trust. And I looked at the bullets and there were no stroke primers, nothing like that. Popped it. And right there, put them by flap like this. And nobody else was armed. At that point, I kind of started getting to know him a little bit personally.

01;43;41;20 - 01;44;01;07
Unknown
Some personal details about who he is and what he does and, you know, other things. You know, he's got a family, which is great because it tells me he's on the right side of things, and he's he loves his family very much, as you should. And, that kind of gave me hope that, okay, this guy actually is taking that in consideration, which tells me everything.

01;44;01;09 - 01;44;19;14
Unknown
And his body language was also what conveyed it to me, too, because he was very fidgety with his watch. He's kind of like trying to adjust himself. And it's like, okay, I know you're telling the truth because this is making you uncomfortable as much as is making me. And there was also sort of an apology that he gave you.

01;44;19;17 - 01;44;42;07
Unknown
Can you talk about that? He apologized on, saying that he's sorry that we went through that, that it's absolutely unnecessary and it's bullshit and shouldn't be happening. Anybody and he knows of instances where they yes, they have murdered people, not him directly, but he will never kill a patriot. He will never kill innocent people. But that guy will murder and kill bad guys, as it should be, because he's like a sheepdog.

01;44;42;09 - 01;44;58;08
Unknown
And all of these guys that I'm working with are the same way. They're all good people. And some people have had confusion to say, oh, we're wild at gunpoint with these guys. But now all of a sudden they're welcoming me in and giving me this, this knowledge and trust. No, it's not the same people. These are the good guys.

01;44;58;10 - 01;45;24;04
Unknown
Very. These guys weren't involved with the operation you witnessed in 2009. No, they were not. But they are aware of those types of. Yes. And they've been on similar operations as that. To my understanding. And so he showed you some things. Yes. You've said you went underground. I can't talk about any of this. Okay. I don't, I don't I'm not going to ask you what you saw.

01;45;24;04 - 01;45;47;00
Unknown
What I, what I want to ask you is, why did he show you that? In the sense of what you could ask is what the things that he has been able to show you are? It was a way of him able to prove who he said, who he really was. That you? What? What? Yes. It wasn't like I can just take his word and just say, okay, I trust you.

01;45;47;01 - 01;46;06;21
Unknown
Yeah. It was a way for them to say these are the real deal, guys, right? Because it's not like anybody can just see this shit. Right? And I hope one day I can get to a point where I can talk about that. And, because it is, it is mind blowing. And I thought what I witnessed, and 14, 15 years ago was mind blowing.

01;46;06;21 - 01;46;40;29
Unknown
Yes, it is, but now you actually see things face to face of what? Yeah. You know, because I'll put it this way. That facility. If these guys were to link up with to politicians and then give them a free access card to everything, it would a single handedly blow the doors off of this whole chicanery of misinformation and all the lies and all the deceit that are being there.

01;46;40;29 - 01;46;59;00
Unknown
This would prove everything, because what's stopping that from happening? They're doing that right now, but they're trying to plan it out. And what way? I don't know, but that's what their goal is. Okay. I, I can't give any details about that being mixed up and all this, but, I can tell you otherwise, but they're they're upset.

01;46;59;02 - 01;47;22;06
Unknown
A lot of them are upset, I guess. I, I guess what I'm getting at is like, what is what are what's their objective with this? Like they want with reaching out to you, informing this partnership or relationship with you? What is their ultimate motive? Because these are these are people who are first hand participants in the program.

01;47;22;06 - 01;47;43;16
Unknown
Yes. For 30 plus years. Yeah. And so they're pro disclosure to a certain extent, pro American, pro freedom, pro life. You know, obviously they don't like that people are being murdered over this kind of stuff. So there's kind of factions within. Yes. That's exactly what people call the program. Yes. And and these are kind of considered the good guys.

01;47;43;16 - 01;48;12;00
Unknown
Yes, who want to support some level of disclosure and, restoring oversight. Yes. By Congress. So the other reason is that these guys were somewhat tasked to try to go through us or infiltrate right. I think, what would have happened is these guys would have been whistleblowers or considered whistleblowers themselves, not in a public fashion like I'm doing or anybody else that's in my shoes.

01;48;12;03 - 01;48;34;04
Unknown
But I think what happened was, now that I came forward and what I experienced is directly related and directly involved with what they've been doing, it was more of a chance for them to say, okay, we can lay low, but now we have a spokesperson for us that can get this information out and tell and help us get information out to the right people.

01;48;34;06 - 01;48;56;29
Unknown
And that was successful, and they'll be able to do that. But I was able I was also successful and able to get them in contact with certain other prominent people. Do these guys, these insiders, have any fear of coming forward? I personally have talked to some whistleblowers who are allegedly afraid to speak because they will lose pension. They will basically they in their family will not have a way to provide they they will lose everything.

01;48;56;29 - 01;49;29;06
Unknown
Okay. If this is not done correctly and carefully. Okay. And I again, I don't know if these guys are coming forward. I can't specifically say that. I don't know, I just maybe one day they will. Who knows. But what do you think needs to happen? Or you know, if you can convey kind of what what these guys have said, what needs to happen or change in order for more firsthand participants like them to be able to come forward, like what needs to happen.

01;49;29;08 - 01;49;45;19
Unknown
The tables need to flip as far as the of the majority of these people in these programs are good people. And that's what I I've from my own interactions with some of these people right now, I'm not working with everybody. Right. But the ones that I know very well now, they're good people. They got their heart in the right place.

01;49;45;20 - 01;50;17;11
Unknown
They got the right mindset for this. What would need to happen is that the tables need to turn as far as them flipping the tables on their own programs, meaning taking control of them personally, getting the bad guys or neutralizing that. However, because what people need to understand is that this group is the enforcement arm of the even the political corruption that's going on because they have assets in certain places and government, local law enforcement, federal law enforcement, military everywhere.

01;50;17;14 - 01;50;45;22
Unknown
So if they are able to single handedly take the bad guys out or flip the script or get gain control of that, because right now there's a war between the good and bad of this, these factions, the bad guys want to keep this secret, and they want to keep this technology to themselves and what they want to commit crimes against humanity with this technology and have this power and control, while the good guys want this to come forward and everybody benefit from it, and us as a species, be able to survive.

01;50;45;24 - 01;51;07;26
Unknown
Also, the fact that they know directly what is going on because they're living in this world, this is their day to day job, so to speak. So, I think now that they have an opportunity to understand that this is affecting other people besides me, besides, I mean, it's affecting all of us because we could be we could really be far in life with this technology.

01;51;07;28 - 01;51;34;25
Unknown
And not only that, we could stop shooting down and craft because who's to say I don't? I've never met any of them. I don't know any ETS or no. I can never came face to face with them. What I can tell you is that I know that the universe is massive and there's multi dimensional universes, or however, this works with the theories that people have proposed.

01;51;34;27 - 01;52;02;19
Unknown
And if that really is the case, the possibility that we can come across a species that ain't going to be too friendly with us as a possibility. So you're telling and this is what the concept is. So this group is going to target them, shoot them down in the deserts all over the world in secluded areas. And they are going to come across at a point, maybe someday that they're going to shoot down the wrong type.

01;52;02;21 - 01;52;43;13
Unknown
And maybe that type becomes a type that decides that, hey, you know what? We don't need these people or we don't need this species around and they decide to we as people who don't even partake in that nonsense, have to pay for it. Meaning that our our lives and as they can instantly do it if they wanted to, with what I have been told and would have understand how powerful they are if they're able to travel interdimensional and through time and space, and be able to show up here and go to any other place that they want to go and be able to control craft through consciousness and be able to pretty much the way

01;52;43;13 - 01;53;02;22
Unknown
that they even said that. And this is just speculation, of course, because I've never seen this personally, but the way that they are actually able to be go through things, be interdimensional, so it can be in 3D or just have the image of. But they can also pastor solid objects like it's almost them. They're molecules or atoms splitting between all of those to separate them somehow.

01;53;02;22 - 01;53;27;23
Unknown
So that's just speculation. But that's what I've been told. And so if you have something that advanced and some some very smart that can end our lives, this whole planet, if they wanted to, and for some reason they choose not to, but yet we keep shooting them down. And I mean us as a human species, right? Right. So, so so you described kind of the next step forward is for the good guys to kind of flip the tables on the bad guys.

01;53;27;23 - 01;54;02;12
Unknown
Yes. But what about the the whole side of like legislation? I mean, is that still an important factor too? Well, that allows certain things to happen to where there is involvement from both sides because there's there's laws that have to be abided by. There's has to be built. There has to be military involvement to an extent. And there's also has to be a law enforcement effort because essentially there's a lot of laws being broken with all of and that's kind of thing that maybe they can get them on a technicality to get some laws passed.

01;54;02;12 - 01;54;25;07
Unknown
And then now all of a sudden, these guys can't hide within that, because now there's proof that there's stuff going on that the law enforcement, like U.S. marshals, for example, because have jurisdiction everywhere, can be the one to execute whatever they need to. Right? That's just that's just technically speaking. And what about like how how can we get more people like the insiders you're working with to come forward?

01;54;25;07 - 01;54;50;01
Unknown
Are there you know, there seems to be kind of like, yeah, we have whistleblower protection, but it's it's really not enough. It's really not enough. That's exactly their concern. Yeah. So what do they think needs to be done from that aspect that these politicians need to get their shit together and they can't be corrupt. And like we're seeing with the whole pushback of the eminent domain and all that kind of stuff, because these aerospace companies are paying some of these guys.

01;54;50;03 - 01;55;04;00
Unknown
So of course, hey, we'll throw you X amount of money if you play ball for us and make it to where it's hard for them to accomplish what they want, because then all of a sudden the game's up. These aerospace companies know what's going on. They're going to pretend that they don't, but they have access to this shit.

01;55;04;02 - 01;55;24;04
Unknown
And it may not even be the executives of these companies who know what's going on. But the contractors and the people that are within these groups know exactly what's going on, have access to it. And it's a very it's relatively a small number. So like every single Boeing personnel or Lockheed Martin or Raytheon or, Northrop Grumman for that matter, what?

Every single person knows what's going on. They don't only certain groups in that too. And to touch quickly on what you were talking about, about shooting down these craft. Are you aware of us in the program with these insiders? If there's kind of an ethical tug of war going on that 100%. Okay. And that's kind of why they, they feel the need to, to want to divulge information to me, to spread it to you guys and to to the world, for that matter.

01;55;48;16 - 01;56;08;10

The other aspect of it, too, is over these installations that, civilian aircraft are being targeted as well when they're flying into these temporary, flight restricted areas or to for us and some people, they work for a flight. When I go see some scenic views of some of these areas that are beautiful nearby, but I happen to stumble into the area just like we did at around went wrong.

01;56;08;10 - 01;56;28;11
Unknown
Point of time. And now they get hit with this experimental weapon. Well, you can't even call them experimental because they're using they're not known. You know, they're they're relatively. Yeah. Are you aware of what these offensive UAP weapons are, how they work? I can't give specifics to a lot of them either, but I only know of a few.

01;56;28;13 - 01;56;46;05
Unknown
But as far as the other ones that are more cutting edge because like, again, they keep refining their systems because they want to make sure that there's they can just take them out with a single hit and have an easier time doing it, I would suppose. You know, that's just speculation, but they're always refining their stuff. There's always refining there.

01;56;47;00 - 01;57;06;26
Unknown
Reverse engineer technologies as well, which is why they test these weapon systems on them. So they had to explain that they put them, they put craft on balloons, have them go up to high altitude, and then they hit them with these weapons because there's nobody aboard. Right. And then they also have them stationary on the ground, and they can hit them at different angles to make sure that it's.

01;57;06;29 - 01;57;12;27
Unknown
But what they have explained to me was that.

01;57;13;00 - 01;57;39;22
Unknown
They're EMP proof. What they have, they are and they're not vulnerable to any kind of modern day munitions like rifle bullets or 50 caliber machine gun ammo or, ammunition or rounds. Missiles can't penetrate through them. You're talking about UAP that they have. Yes. Okay. That they they as in these this groups if they really retrieved well that they've designed and made oh reverse engineered.

01;57;39;22 - 01;57;59;26
Unknown
So like the RV reverse. Yes. That most of the ones that are coming out and this is what some of the insiders had said, they are having a very hard time distinguishing the real craft from any high compared to the ones that they've got. That's how far they've came with this technology. They can't identify one from the other.

01;57;59;28 - 01;58;29;01
Unknown
It's getting to that point. So it's practically been a year since like almost to like within a week. Yes. Came forward. Correct. What's next for you and like has your motivation for coming forward now changed? Like has your objective now changed now that you've met with the insider and kind of gotten involved? Yes. Yes, it has, because I feel like I can now help these guys in any way that I possibly can.

01;58;29;01 - 01;58;44;11
Unknown
I have been doing that behind the scenes, and it's good. It feels good to do that, and it feels good to be on the right side of history with this. And when everything does come to a head, hopefully there can be some positive movements that blow this all wide open and we can all benefit. We could all be better people at the end of the day.

01;58;44;11 - 01;59;03;00
Unknown
That's what I want. That's my mission. The other aspect is obviously being provided the information that people are being taken and used in these programs. That doesn't sit well with me. When I heard that I couldn't sleep for a week. There's many times where I've hidden in the bathroom and literally busted down fucking crying because it's like, I can't.

01;59;03;00 - 01;59;26;20
Unknown
I couldn't do anything to stop that at that time. Which sucks to know that you're completely helpless. So I feel like it's my mission to get the right oversight to an extent. And maybe there can be things that can happen on a, on a global scale that get these programs to be known programs, maybe the right ways can be done with these where people don't have to be sedated.

01;59;26;24 - 01;59;55;07
Unknown
People don't have to be treated as if they're biological equipment or pink assets, as they call them, that they can actually have people gain a foothold and do this peacefully and make us all better people. And everybody can live happily, everybody can live evolved. We can stop paying utilities because free energy will be a thing. Maybe my I mean, I got fast cars, but maybe I can get some faster shit that I can drive around or fly around in for that matter, however that comes about.

01;59;55;07 - 02;00;18;19
Unknown
But, you know, I think I think with optimism is that our world can be significantly better, but we have to go through some very hard times for this to happen. I don't have children, but I know you do. And I know that your children do benefit from having a better world, that they can grow up and experience and not have to go through the corruption and see what we're dealing with.

02;00;18;19 - 02;00;39;09
Unknown
Those people right now who understand what's going on. And I know these insiders families also deserve the same. You know, like I said, I don't want any money from this. All I want is for this to come forward. Now, I want this world to get better and change. That's my mission. And you know anybody who has any problems with me not accepting money?

02;00;39;11 - 02;00;57;06
Unknown
Tough shit. I make my own money. I'm not bought and paid for. Like most of these people who try to keep this shit hidden or secret or threaten them, they can threaten me all they want, but it's known as pissing us off and getting pissed off enough when we actually do something that actually. Because here's the here's the problem.

02;00;57;08 - 02;01;14;05
Unknown
As much as I would like to say or believe me, everybody, because what I'm saying can be verified to an extent which I choose not to because I'm keeping people safe in the process. As you guys know. But,

02;01;14;08 - 02;01;33;00
Unknown
Be skeptical because there are people coming forward who should not be, or they're muddying the waters to an extent and are very known people. I don't get in drama of this shit. I don't care to. I've got my direction of where I'm going and that's what I'm focused on. I let other people gossip and talk. Well, I'm just focused.

02;01;33;03 - 02;01;52;04
Unknown
So that's what they can do. People need to understand that. Yes, as much as I want people to believe what I'm saying. But at the end of the day, disclosure is about evidence. It's not about testimony. It's not about what I say. If I had proof. So do you think evidence is coming at some point? Very much so.

02;01;52;06 - 02;02;07;28
Unknown
How it will happen? I have no idea. Yeah, but I hope it does. And I hope it comes full force, because then it's going to kind of catch a lot of people with their pants down, people who pretend in the government that they don't know what's going on, but they they will do because they're getting paid from it under the table.

02;02;08;06 - 02;02;33;14
Unknown
Right. So it's going to be interesting how. Oh, yeah. You didn't know that this existed, but here's some documentation. Or some people were saying that you were paid for it. Yeah, they got this material or whatever it is that they have that's actually out. And now people know for a fact, oh shit. And entirety exist, guys. And we've had access to this and we've been in communication to an extent for a very long time.

02;02;33;16 - 02;02;51;16
Unknown
And I just got to ask two quick closing questions, if you don't mind. I think it was on the Total Disclosure podcast you talked about that you had been in contact with David Gross. Can you comment on that? I've talked to him and that's all I can say. Okay. And two, this is just kind of a personal one because I've seen this bounced around a lot.

02;02;51;18 - 02;03;13;05
Unknown
I have seen many people call you Joey and Joey, your publicist. You two are not the same person. Yeah. Joey, are you Michael's publicist at all? Are you anything other than a private citizen who's investigating Michael's case, a random guy? Are you paid for by Michael? No. Man. Yeah, I know, I can imagine. That's the stuff that's like.

02;03;13;05 - 02;03;33;07
Unknown
It's just like, you know, Reddit. Most people are just anonymous on Reddit. Yeah, I kind of, and I, and I just remained anonymous. Well, now, you know, I'm showing my face now for the first time and just trying to crack that open a little bit. Me? Yeah. You know, well, I mean, there will be a right time where everything can be the hardest and every everybody can sleep better, you know?

02;03;33;09 - 02;03;51;15
Unknown
But, I just saw what you were doing on Reddit, and it's like, you know what? You're a very good person to get information out. I don't know anybody else. And thanks to you, thanks to you, you've been able to link me up with people who have. Who? Yeah. Yeah. You're very good at networking too. And that's part of the reason why I'm successful is because networking is key.

02;03;51;18 - 02;04;10;08
Unknown
And that's, I use the same approach of disclosure. So if I'm in touch with people who are pivotal with this movement, then I'm able to contribute in ways that I possibly can to to bring this forward to an extent or however far we can get. And you introduce me to him, you know, which is great because you guys are wonderful guys, very good people, you know?

02;04;10;08 - 02;04;30;15
Unknown
So it's good talking to you guys and just even shooting the shit when we're not talking about the same stuff, you know? So I can't believe we're sitting here. This is. I know it's been a long time coming in a long time. I'm like, you know, if I had time to go out there, I'd definitely go out there and see where you know, what your part of the world is like and yeah, see what you do day to day and you get to experience.

02;04;30;19 - 02;04;57;22
Unknown
You busy with everything, you guys. Yeah, I'm surprised I'm not completely bald yet, but it's getting there. But I got some hams. I'm trying, so hopefully that helps. But you know, if not then I'm just going to be another whistleblower. The rocket just was awesome. I, you know, so grateful that you sat down with us and, just, you know, excited to kind of see how things unfold moving forward.

02;04;57;28 - 02;05;19;19
Unknown
So. Well, I mean, from what I kind of understand and maybe pivotal to a point where we get the the grip on the right way and it comes forward and everybody understands it doesn't have to be secret anymore.
