For decades, debate has raged on in ufology about the existence of a committee of elite military leaders, government officials and scientists tasked with the investigation, study and collection of UFOs and their occupants. This now infamous group was revealed through hundreds of allegedly leaked documents over the course of 1984 to 1999, to be titled the majestic 12 or MJ 12.

00;00;23;05 - 00;00;47;16
Unknown
Any viewer of my work will know I often reference the majestic documents in MJ 12, such as my Del Rio case, where I bring up the majestic document called the Eisenhower Briefing Document, in which I reference a December 1950 UFO crash retrieval stated to have occurred near the Mexican Texas border between El Indio and Guerrera. A crash retrieval Lou Elizondo has now stated to have occurred in his 2024 book imminent.

00;00;47;18 - 00;01;25;19
Unknown
So, with the contentious nature surrounding the majestic documents and ufology, the debunking work done by professional skeptic Philip K glass and others alongside the FBI's work to haphazardly write bogus across one set of documents to label all documents is false. Why cover the majestic documents? To me, the analysis of MJ 12 and the majestic documents must consist of studying the documents themselves, their origins, content, provenance and connective tissue to not only other majestic documents, but also acknowledged and declassified files like the work done by the legendary Stanton Friedman and world class Ryan Wood.

00;01;25;21 - 00;02;07;22

This is why today I have partnered with fantastic UFO researcher Ryan Eastwood to explore the majestic documents Ryan and his father, Doctor Robert Wood, a former McDonnell Douglas rocket scientist, have spent decades painstakingly scrutinizing the entire catalog of majestic documents to unravel the mystery that is the majestic 12. Hey guys, it's UAP, Gerb, and thank you so very much for joining the author of Magic Eyes Only and myself, as we discussed the authenticity, origin and context of the majestic documents with the revelations of David Grush in the 21st century, the reality of UFO crash retrieval and reverse engineering has made its way into the public sight.

00;02;07;22 - 00;02;32;19

Geist. This is why we must take a closer inspection of the highly debated group allegedly first tasked with a UFO crash retrievals, the majestic 12. Before we get into the interview, I want to take a brief moment to introduce the majestic 12. For any newcomer to the subject, I highly recommend reading Top Secret Magic by Stanton Friedman, studying Majestic Documents, Xcom written by Ryan and Doctor Bob.

00;02;32;22 - 00;03;01;09
Unknown
My all time favorite book, Magic Eyes Only by Ryan S wood, or reading The Incredible Medium articles by blocked. Epistemology. The majestic 12 is a group known from a series of controversial leaked documents to have been tasked with UFO study collection and analysis. The group seemingly rose to power around the time of the 1947 Roswell, New Mexico crash, but with origins extending even earlier, around 1941 or 1942.

00;03;01;11 - 00;03;27;19
Unknown
According to Stanton Friedman, the group allegedly consisted of 12 members MJ one through 12, consisting of six civilian and six military personnel of the military people, two representatives each from the Army, Navy and Air Force served in the MJ 12. The private sector saw seasoned research and development organizers and very strong intelligence community leaders participate in the group.

00;03;27;22 - 00;03;58;10
Unknown
Viewers of my Robert SA Baker video will remember Doctor Vannevar Bush, head of the Office of Scientific Research and Development, who was labeled a crucial founding member of the majestic. 12. Other original members named in the majestic documents include General Nathan Twining, the leader of Project Sign aka Project Sorcerer. In 1948, James Forrestal, Secretary of the Navy and first US Secretary of Defense, who conveniently threw himself out of a hospital window in 1949 Donald H.

00;03;58;11 - 00;04;25;11

Menzel, astronomer at Harvard and high security consultant to the NSA and CIA Roscoe H. Hillen, coder, admiral, Navy intelligence and first director of the CIA Walter B Smith, general in the U.S. Army, ambassador to the USSR, second director to the CIA and four Stars replacement. And Hoyt S Vandenberg, USAF general, second director of the Central Intelligence Group, Air Force Chief of Staff.

00;04;25;18 - 00;04;57;08
Unknown
And this is just a slice of the total members. I highly recommend analyzing the MJ 12 master list created by Ryan Wood. Many over the years have hypothesized what the magic in MJ 12 stands for. User blocked epistemology hypothesizes. This name is derived from the 1945 Mae Johnson Atomic Energy Bill. Excellent Reddit researcher user Harry is white hot believed magic was some sort of continuation of a very high classification standard titled magic, used during World War Two.

00;04;57;10 - 00;05;23;01
Unknown
I find myself believing magic is an abbreviation for a Joint Intelligence Committee, possibly something along the lines of a majority joint intelligence Committee 12 but without further ado, let's talk to Ryan S wood and begin to dive into the origins of the documents. Yeah, well, the broad brush is that there's some 3500 pages over 19 years from seven different sources.

00;05;23;04 - 00;06;10;11
Unknown
The first event was in 1984 when Jamie Chandor, which is an LA producer, TV producer, I believe, received the Eisenhower briefing document, which Stan Friedman, ultimately got. It outlines the original 12 MJ MJ 12 members, in that document. And that's the one that was taken, around to the FBI. And several people, some did it to the FBI because the FBI's responsible for, leaks of classified documents, and and the FBI took it to a variety of three letter agencies and said, did you lose this?

00;06;10;14 - 00;06;56;23
Unknown
And they said, well, no, we didn't lose this. We don't know anything about it. And so after their process, they declared it bogus. And despite the efforts of Stan Freedman to authenticate a whole variety of people that were MJ 12 members and then the other, two different sources for that same document that, came into the field, years after that, some with different marginalia, some with, slightly different three hole punching.

00;06;56;23 - 00;07;23;18
Unknown
And so, I mean, they are stunningly authentic, an original paper or something like that. But there are some other sources of that same document, that have had surfaced over time. But it was a briefing for Eisenhower, and that was the first one. And that sort of kick things off and got, Stan Freedman really pushing along.

00;07;23;20 - 00;08;06;06

Returning viewers of my channel will know the first ever majestic document quite well, the top secret magic eyes on the Eisenhower briefing document. This document, stating to contain compartmentalized information essential to U.S. national security, was organized to brief president incumbent Dwight Eisenhower on the majestic 12 Group on November 18th, 1952. The document labels Operation Majestic 12 as a top secret R&D intelligence operation, reporting solely to the president of the United States, set up by a classified executive order of president Harry Truman by recommendation of Doctor Vannevar Bush and Secretary Forrestal on the 24th of September, 1947.

00;08;06;08 - 00;08;34;21
Unknown
Funny enough, in the Daily Appointment The History of Harry Truman, we can find a meeting with Secdef James Forrestal and Doctor Vannevar Bush, arranged at the suggestion of Forrestal. The briefing document includes a list of all 12 sitting 12 members, including General Walter B Smith, who replaced the deceased Secretary Forrestal on August 1st, 1950. And again we can find an actual appointment held off record with Truman and Walter B Smith on this exact date.

00;08;34;23 - 00;09;16;17
Unknown
The briefing document discusses the hysteria caused by saucer sightings of Kenneth Arnold in the summer of 1947 and subsequent failures to pursue these discs in flight. July 7th, 1947 oversaw the beginning of the MG 12 with the Roswell crash northwest of Roswell. Army Airfield experienced the now most famous UFO crash in history, which, according to the Eisenhower briefing document, saw craft and body collection efforts by General Nathan Twining and Doctor Vannevar Bush, a soon to be sitting MG 12 member, Doctor Detlev Bronk, performed autopsies on the bodies and coined the term ebby or extraterrestrial biological entity.

00;09;16;19 - 00;09;45;07
Unknown
The Roswell team and Doctor Donald Menzel concluded the craft was of non-human origin and likely originated from a solar system far removed from our own. The report discusses forms of writing on the Roswell craft, something primary witness Jesse Marcel, senior and junior, would claim to witness on a small piece of metallic debris. The Roswell report led directly to the creation of Project Sign, Grudge and Blue Book, with very limited interaction between these official programs and the majestic 12.

00;09;45;12 - 00;10;09;04
Unknown
And I'll draw your attention back to a whistleblower. I covered Brigadier General Stephen Lumpkin, who claimed to observed pieces of Roswell debris in a classified portion of Project Blue Book, far removed from the official reports. The document then discusses the 1950 El Indio crash, touched on in 2024 by Lou Elizondo, and makes specific mention of the Atomic Energy Commission and Sandia National Labs.

00;10;09;06 - 00;10;39;00
Unknown
Curiously, near the end of the document is listed a Contingency plan MJ Dash 1949, dash zero four, P/78. And just remember that contingency plan. Tireless work was done by Stanton Friedman authenticating the Eisenhower briefing document in his book Top Secret Slash Magic. But there are two specific investigations I want to mention. In 1989, Friedman physically traveled to the National Archives and reviewed files of the office for the Secretary of Defense.

00;10;39;03 - 00;11;04;12
Unknown
Within these documents were numerous November 18th, 1952 briefing documents for president elect Eisenhower. None of these briefings mentioned MJ 12, but it is fact the Truman administration was indeed briefing Eisenhower on this date. Investigation. Two circles around the labeled briefing Officer, Admiral Roscoe H. Hill and coder Debunkers of the majestic documents claim Helen Coder was sent to Korea in 1950.

00;11;04;12 - 00;11;49;24
Unknown
For six years, however, Friedman was able to determine Helen Coder was indeed present in Brooklyn, New York in late 1952, when he was made head of the third Naval District in New York, so Helen Coder could have indeed been present at the Washington Briefings on November 1952, and many MJ 12 files with Helen Coder as a key individual exist, though they do require further research such as this February 11th, 1948 Hill encoder to Truman Majestic Black Book Summaries document, which makes direct mention to magic or the September 19th, 1963 CIA Director Hill Encoder to Donald Menzel memo, which sees the director congratulating his fellow alleged MJ 12 member on his book regarding what we can

00;11;49;24 - 00;12;16;08
Unknown
assume was successful obfuscation of the UFO reality. And lastly, we have some key clues. On a September 19th, 1947 memo from Helen Coder to Joint Intelligence Committee. This majestic document memo, allegedly dated just before Bush and also request to create MJ 12, is titled, quote, memorandum for the Military Assessment of the Joint Intelligence Committee and quote, aka magic.

00;12;16;11 - 00;12;56;05
Unknown
The memo requests a classified intelligence project. Quote we recovered one craft, captured one end quote. This memo states no clear, coordinated scientific examination was possible until, quote unquote. We got a clear directive from the president. The memo also states right field had a new biological laboratory. The Joint Research and Development Board, and the FBI, MI5 and MI6 were helping with the effort and finally goes back to Mr. Wood, the other one that's really big, is the Special Operations manual, Extraterrestrial Entities Technology Recovery and Disposal.

00;12;56;08 - 00;13;28;07
Unknown
And that was leaked in 1994, to Don Berliner, who was an Aviation week and space reporter in Washington, DC. And it was, an undeveloped, film, came in a little green box and they went and my father and I and, well, not me, but my father and Don went to the darkroom and developed it and got all the the original images.

00;13;28;10 - 00;13;56;22
Unknown
I, I'll just pull a couple, sheets out just for fun, to show you this is, you know, it came in an echo binder, along along the edge over here. And, and also became with the change control page, which is difficult to see, but it says Kirkland Air Force Base. Unit KB 88, building 21, Kirkland Air Force Base.

00;13;56;22 - 00;14;30;07
Unknown
And impact X, we found that, there was a building 21 I think it's now called building 40. Back then and the fact that, the abbreviation for the stamp, Kirkland Air Force Base and, that X, is the correct postal abbreviation for 1954 for New Mexico. If it said name, that would have been a hallmark of of fakery.

00;14;30;09 - 00;14;56;25
Unknown
Or an anachronism that would be worthy of lots of investigation. Mr. wood and myself will speak on the Special Operations manual throughout this video, so we will only go into brief detail here. The manual, according to Ryan Wood, Doctor Robert Wood and Stanton Friedman, is equally, if not more authentic than the Eisenhower briefing document. Friedman has even stated, quote, the majestic 12 documents problem is complex and extensive.

00;14;56;28 - 00;15;22;22
Unknown
On balance, it appears that the EBD, TFM, and CTM are almost certainly genuine. The Psalm 101 memo is very likely genuine. End quote debate has raged on for decades now. If the document is a hoax, real or possibly Soviet disinformation, later in the interview, we will do an entire analysis into the Special Operations Manual or the Psalm 101, as I'll refer to it.

00;15;22;25 - 00;15;51;14
Unknown
But for now, understand this manual, allegedly written in 1954 and initially housed in Kirtland Air Force Base, serves as a comprehensive summary of majestic operations for quote unquote, majestic 12 units and quote unquote authorized personnel. The manual contains everything from MJ 12 full operational capacity and modus operand II, NHC craft and body descriptions to MJ 12 recovery and disinformation protocols.

00;15;51;21 - 00;16;17;13
Unknown
Similar to his masterpiece Magic Eyes only Ryan Wood has attributed a weighted authenticity rating to every document based on factors such as direct firsthand witnesses, forensic analysis of possible document source, etc. The Special Operations Manual and Eisenhower Briefing Document are two of the few pieces wood has rated with the highest level of authenticity. But are there others with such high confidence?

00;16;17;19 - 00;16;52;10
Unknown
But I would also add the Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit document. Because the governments acknowledge the existence of the Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit, part of the Stephen J. Chamberlin, Assistant Chief of Staff for intelligence, Technical and Scientific Directorate, counterintelligence Group, IPU. Interplanetary phenomena. You know, all these hierarchies down, in, in the, you know, 40s, time frame. Well, this was 47, where the epub document.

00;16;52;10 - 00;17;38;09
Unknown
But what's interesting about the IPU document, which is on majestic documents.com, people can read it. And in my book, Magic Eyes only, is details about the Roswell, crash. You know, when it crashed at 2332 mountain Standard Time and dropped off radar, and it had discussions of, of of body parts inside the craft, in the handwritten notes and, it had discussions of autopsies of the aliens done by Delyth Bronk and, Charles Ethan Ray, which, you know, when I started to look around, I said, who is who's Charles?

00;17;38;09 - 00;18;08;28
Unknown
Ethan Ray. And he was a medical corps. Expert with, Leslie Groves, the head of the Manhattan Project. And and I called up his daughter, in Seattle and said, you know, do you think your father could have autopsied an alien? And she didn't hesitate at all and said, yes. Not that she knew that he did it, but it's clear in her mind that, oh, absolutely.

00;18;08;28 - 00;18;44;08
Unknown
This is the sort of stuff he would have been tapped to do. So, I mean, there there's just more and more details, stories about the IPU and that, that document. And so those three, I mean, the each one has its own basket of, interesting facts and authenticity. Viewers of this channel will know. Recently I have been discussing the interplanetary phenomenon unit, the U.S. Army's in-house unofficial department in the 50s for an assistant chief of staff for intelligence to study UFOs.

00;18;44;10 - 00;19;10;11
Unknown
The IPU initially discovered through foyer requests after initial DoD denial, exists only through quote unquote institutional memory. I highly recommend reading Anthony Bregoli, his piece on the IPU. The existence of this division was first revealed on September 6th, 1980, in a FOIA request by Richard Hall and later confirmed in a 1984 FOIA request by UFO researcher William Steinman.

00;19;10;11 - 00;19;38;02
Unknown
It took until the 1990s for the USG to state all records were destroyed, even though Hall's 1980 request oversaw the Army Director of Counterintelligence State, all IPU records were surrendered to Bluebook anyways, as Ryan stated on Majestic documents.com, we can find two IPU documents within the MJ 12 documents IPU Field Order and IPU report. The interplanetary phenomenon Field Order List July 4th, 1947.

00;19;38;02 - 00;20;06;04
Unknown
Correspondence of a situation occurring the day before the memo, requesting personnel, including an aeronautical engineer and medical doctor, cleared for quote, need to know and quote, and this date should ring a bell as occurring right before the Roswell crash. The IPU report first made its way into the public on July 16th, 1995, and lists astonishing information authorized by Lieutenant General John Sanford and approved by CIA Director Allen Dulles.

00;20;06;04 - 00;20;42;26
Unknown
Some of you may remember Sanford giving the famous press conference alongside Roswell General Roger Ramey post the 1952 UFOs over Washington, DC incident. This document explores in great detail the events of the Roswell UFO crash, including initial tracking and assessment of the two sides of the crash. The disk A very key clue in this document is the mention that some Roswell Army Airfield investigators at LS1, the debris field seen by Brazel and Marcel, thought the wreckage may have been a Project Mogul balloon until Los Alamos personnel determined the wreckage was something, quote unquote, out of this world.

00;20;42;29 - 00;21;07;25
Unknown
If you know anything about the Roswell crash, you'll know it's often explained away as a project mogul balloon, and this was revealed after the initial weather balloon cover story in the US Air Force's 1994 report, The Roswell Report. The Roswell report states the mogul flight that was misidentified as a large metallic flying saucer with bodies was mogul flight Number four, which allegedly launched on June 4th, 1947.

00;21;07;27 - 00;21;35;19
Unknown
However, in 2024, Project Mogul's field operations director, Doctor Alan Crary, revealed with evidence Flight number four never took place on this day and was indeed canceled due to weather anyways, the IPU report states. A radio biological team and security detail from Sandia National Labs were summoned by Colonel S.B. Hasbrouck. Chosen scientists consisted of AEC personnel, including J. Robert Oppenheimer, Wernher von Braun, and others.

00;21;35;21 - 00;22;03;03
Unknown
And before you say this sounds too fantastical, remember von Braun's mentor, Herman Osbourne, performed serious analysis on UFO flight characteristics. Twining, Vandenberg, and others are named within this report as aiding in the recovery effort and overall operation. And an interesting line here, quote. It has become known to CIC that some of the recovery operation was shared with Representative John F Kennedy and quote, I'm not going to spend too much more time on the IPU report.

00;22;03;03 - 00;22;25;10
Unknown
But as would stated, Detlev Bronk is named as assisting in the autopsy. The report then discusses the nine bodies body parts seemingly dissected, similar to a frog's scattered at the primary crash site, and the death of multiple Sandia lab techs due to a form of contamination. And I recently discussed this contamination in my 1974 Koyama Mexico crash retrieval case.

00;22;25;17 - 00;22;59;22
Unknown
Based on the documents, Ryan Wood has the most confidence are in fact legitimate. I asked him to describe robustly what exactly compromises the majestic 12, how various named members fit into the group, and the impact such an organization had on ufology. At the time of the initial MMX 12 documents being leaked, well, it's a top secret research and development intelligence gathering organization that was formed by executive Order of the President in September 24th, 1947.

00;22;59;25 - 00;23;29;28
Unknown
You know, 1947 was when the Atomic Energy Act, was created, when the CIA was created and the OSS was transitioned, Office of Strategic Services, which was the CIA at the time, into the CIA. And and they formed this top secret research and development intelligence gathering organization. And it was, you know, headed by Vannevar Bush, part of the, Office of Research and Development.

00;23;30;00 - 00;24;07;29
Unknown
OSD and this is where, Eric Walker, doctor Eric Walker lived, working for Vannevar Bush and ultimately took over the organization and was widely understood to be, familiar with MJ 12. We were leading it, in that group. So the the names of the people, caught a lot of attention. And Stan did a lot of work and has written, his book, Top Secret Magic, I think, which highlights a lot of the research around the various people.

00;24;08;01 - 00;24;39;00
Unknown
I if you dug into Carl Sagan, which was, a person that shouldn't have been on the list, sort of, you know, he was a big debunker. And but when Stan finally went to the various archives and dug around, he found lots of correspondence, between other MJ 12 members and, And so that was, you know, interesting.

00;24;39;03 - 00;25;11;21
Unknown
And and powerful, for the authenticity of the document. But it was, again, it was a photocopy. What actually was film? It was it was undeveloped film, just like the special operations manual that arrived, it might have been from the same source, but it certainly wasn't mailed the same way. Pay close attention here to the name of Doctor Eric, a walker in my video on physicist Robert SA Walker, I discussed how Doctor Saab Walker directly named Vannevar Bush as a key figure studying UFOs within the US government.

00;25;11;24 - 00;25;35;06
Unknown
During conversations with Stanton Friedman, doctor SA Baker, who was a member of Bush's Research and Development Board, mentioned Doctor Eric A Walker as a key figure connected to UFO crash retrievals. Walker was contacted by researcher William Steinman and not only confirmed the existence of the majestic 12, but actually admitted his own presence at the 1965 Kecksburg Pennsylvania crash retrieval.

00;25;35;09 - 00;26;18;18
Unknown
I highly recommend revisiting my video here. So, I mean, going to the special operations manual that you mentioned, with, the Ray Z. There's so many hallmarks of authenticity in that particular document. I could start with the fact that we took it to, a retired government printing officer, general, not general, but, McCarter, in Washington, DC, he had he retired from the US government Printing Office maybe like six months before we we visited him and we, you know, went to his house and set it up on a card table and slid the document across.

00;26;18;18 - 00;26;39;01
Unknown
And he looked at it and said, well, you know, by the title Extraterrestrial Entities, Technology Recovery, Disposal, I would think it's fake. But then he flipped through the documents and saw that the Zs were raised and said, this is an artifact of hot, like, printing press, besides the fact that he checked it for everything. I mean, he said the the fonts are right.

00;26;39;03 - 00;27;16;18
Unknown
The, indentations are correct. The use of em dashes, in MJ 12 long dash clearance is correct. But the capitalization of of first aid, was correct for the period. So he went through a bunch of subtleties that we didn't understand or perceived at the time to highlight the fact that it was, it was real in his mind and, and ultimately concluded that, yeah, the CIA probably printed it in a cage down on 10th Street.

00;27;16;21 - 00;27;45;00
Unknown
In that that was his, opinion at the time, with Mr. Wood passionately discussing his authentication methods of the MJ 12 Special Operations Manual. Now is the perfect time to discuss the contents of this absolutely mind boggling document. Psalm one was sent anonymously to Don Berliner in 1994 and consisted of undeveloped 35 millimeter tricks film authenticated to 1954, labeled Top Secret Magic Eyes Only.

00;27;45;00 - 00;28;14;14
Unknown
The manual details the full operational capacity and mission of the majestic 12. As mentioned by Mr.. Would we see the document control is regressed to a singular stamp of Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico. The document control page shows us MJ 12 members MJ zero one and MJ zero four, who altered the document from 1954 to 1958. Initials listed here are well and JRT, two names Ryan has actually tracked, and we will discuss shortly.

00;28;14;19 - 00;28;37;12
Unknown
And now we get into the meat of this document. Quote. This manual has been prepared especially for majestic 12 unit and quote, its purpose is to present all aspects of MJ 12 so authorized personnel will have a better understanding of the goals of the group, be able to more expertly deal with UFOs, ET, tech and entities, and increase the efficiency of future operations.

00;28;37;20 - 00;29;11;11
Unknown
Section one project goals and purposes of this document make some startling revelations one MJ 12 considers unidentified flying Objects UFO BS to be a matter of the very highest order of national security. Two there would be a negative impact on the public with general knowledge of the UFO situation. Three danger present if advanced tech falls into the hands of adversaries, and four MJ 12 was established on the 24th of September, 1947 under recommendation by Vannevar Bush and Forrestal.

00;29;11;13 - 00;29;43;20
Unknown
The goals of MJ 12 are clearly outlined here as well. One recovery for scientific study of all materials and devices of foreign or ET manufacture. Recovery by any and all means by group. This immediately reminds me of the 1974 Koyama case with the American Retrieval team finding the craft in Mexico at all costs to recovery for study of all entities and remains of entities of non-terrestrial origin through independent action by those entities, or by misfortune or military action.

00;29;43;26 - 00;30;27;02

Well, naturally, when you recover something that's either landed or crashed, sometimes you encounter, dead pilots and, believe it or not, as as fantastical as that sounds, it's true. Three establishment and administration of special teams to accomplish the above operations. Which reminds me, for the third video in a row of Christopher Sharp's article on the CIA, Ogah and J SoC being behind crash retrieval operations for establishment and admin of special secure facilities located at secret locations within USA for providing, receiving, processing, analysis and study of any and all materials and entities classified as extraterrestrial.

00;30;27;07 - 00;30;53;22
Unknown
Five covert operations carried in collusion with the CIA, both home and abroad, and six establishment and absolute secrecy of all operations as of the time of the alleged creation of this document in 1954, MJ 12 does not consider any try to be a threat consisting of a benign presence, but with technology far beyond human science. The group had in possession several recovered dead biologics.

00;30;53;24 - 00;31;31;15
Unknown
Section one general begins to define the scope of the majestic 12 determination, documentation, collection and disposition of debris devices, craft and occupants. This section defines ETD technology as aircraft not manufactured by human power objects that appear as one of several shapes and configurations, and exhibit extraordinary flight characteristics consisting of materials exhibiting characteristics beyond science, and this section even describes EBS creatures, humanoid or otherwise, whose evolutionary process differs demonstrably from that of Homo sapiens.

And now we get to my favorite part of this entire document. The description of the craft. Elliptical or disc shaped craft appear to be metallic and dull in color, whose appearance consists of two pie pans or shallow dishes pressed together. Psalm 101 even lists some dimensions of these craft. They are 50 to 300ft in diameter, with their thickness near 50% of the total diameter.

00;31;55;24 - 00;32;18;21
Unknown
A dome extends above the disk, about 30% of the disk diameter, and extends 4 to 6ft above the main body. This dome may or may not include windows or ports. Lights on the craft exist on the top, bottom, and rim that only function during operation. There's no antenna or projections, but there are three extendable sets of landing gear.

00;32;18;24 - 00;32;46;27
Unknown
Cigar shape or Tic Tacs are considered very rare. They can be 2000ft long and 95ft thick. They do not operate in lower atmosphere and travel at excess of seven K miles per hour. They do not engage in the rapid, erratic or instantaneous maneuvers the smaller craft do. The ovoid, circular or teardrop shapes look almost like an ice cream cone round at the large end and tapering to a near point at the other?

00;32;47;00 - 00;33;09;14
Unknown
They are 30 to 40ft long and have a diameter 20% of the length. The craft have a bright light at the end point and the craft travels pointing down. And lastly we have the airfoil or triangular shape. These were considered new tech due to rarity of recent observations, as the craft appear to be an isosceles triangle, with their longest side being near 300ft length.

00;33;09;16 - 00;33;32;20
Unknown
Little was known about the performance capabilities, but they operated apparently similar to the disk or ovoid shape. Psalm 101 then begins to go into description of extraterrestrial biological entities, listing a type one and type two. And thank you to Bill McDonald for the art here. EB ones look humanoid. They are 5 to 5ft four inches tall, weighing 80 to 100 pounds.

00;33;32;22 - 00;33;58;18
Unknown
They have larger, more rounded craniums with chalky yellow, thick, slightly pebbled pale skin. They have small eyes, wide set that are almost almond shape with brownish black irises and very large pupils in gray whites. Their mouths are wide, nearly limitless. They have fine hair, not confine to underarm and groin. Their body is thin with no fat and good muscles.

00;33;58;21 - 00;34;20;22
Unknown
EB one has small hands, four long digits, no thumb but webbing. The description of the type two EB will remind you as much more of a classic gray. They are humanoid, but three feet 5in to 4ft two inches tall, weighing 25 to 50 pounds. Their large, elongated head is larger proportionally to that of a human or EB one.

00;34;20;28 - 00;34;43;27
Unknown
Their eyes are large, slanted, and nearly wrap around their head, showing only pure black. The nose appears to be two small slits above a slit like mouth with no external ears. Their skin is pale blue, grayish, fine, settled and smooth. They have no hair, leading MG 12 to believe these creatures are not mammalian. Their hands have three long fingers plus a long thumb.

00;34;43;29 - 00;35;28;25
Unknown
They have four toes jointed with a membrane. The document then gives astounding descriptions of extraterrestrial technology recovered from crash sites from 1947 to 1953. This date range includes Roswell to Kingman. Metallurgical analyzes show the materials were not known to terrestrial science at the time. The material showed incredible strength and extreme resistance in proportion to weight and size, appearing similar to aluminum foil or aluminum magnesium sheeting, identical to the claims of primary Roswell witnesses Jesse Marcel Senior down to the inclusion of inscriptions on material in the press blackout section, we find information extremely pertinent to today's age media denial, discrediting witnesses, deceptive statements.

00;35;28;27 - 00;35;55;11
Unknown
There are countless examples I can discuss here, but I recommend watching my UFO stigma video and paying key attention to the Robertson Panel and Condon Committee, and also look at the reprisals against David Grush. Secure the area, removal and transport and cleaning the area, all detail systems and protocol for crash retrieval. What is of extreme interest? Here is the specific mention that any specific craft or device that appears to be functional is designated to Red team.

00;35;55;13 - 00;36;18;08
Unknown
I can't help but think back to Ray and how one piece of technology he observed at the Off World Technologies division was designated a weapon during recovery due to an energetic discharge, but I asked Mr. Wood if he had ever come across this red team before. I'd have to look. But, I mean, I recall, blue, blue, fly and blue teams as well.

00;36;18;10 - 00;36;51;10
Unknown
I mean, I think the term red team and blue team are the same teams, so to speak, and crash retrievals. But, you know, right in the front description of the special operations manual, they have, they mentioned these MMX, 12 recovery teams. And I think in the, well, you know, at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, they call it the Blue lab.

00;36;51;13 - 00;37;25;27
Unknown
Now on to section 16, special or unusual conditions has a very interesting note here. Should the need for public disclosure become necessary, the majestic team was to issue contingency plan 1949. Dash zero four. Peace last 78. Remember this from the Eisenhower briefing document. We don't have the contingency plan. It's it's interesting that, in the back of the special operations manual, there's a series of references, in that in the back and they they weren't supplied.

00;37;25;29 - 00;38;00;28
Unknown
That's the missing appendix two, right? Yeah. That's the missing appendix for references. I mean, it's it's it's in the, in the back here. But, the, for example, the photographic references were, were all correct. And you can go find them, so that they're correctly referenced in the back. And then there's also the, another sort of authenticity point is the, the UFO be identified flying object object.

00;38;01;00 - 00;38;33;21
Unknown
Identification guide that, is listed in the manual but was not supplied as a, as photocopies, original photocopies, but other FOIA documents. They provided a typed version of it, not typeset, but just typed. But when my father retyped it all following the format of the manual, it perfectly matched the page numbers in the table of contents and fit like a glove right in there.

00;38;33;24 - 00;39;09;10
Unknown
Section 17 extraterrestrial Classification table is truly consequential for analyzing this document. Intact craft damaged devices identified in unidentified fragments and weapons were all to go to area 51 S4. If you say area 51 wasn't built in 1954, we'll discuss the shortly media. Electronic recordings, maps, charts, etc. were to go to Kirtland Air Force Base. Building 21. Supplies and provisions, as well as deceased entities were to be sent to Wright-Patterson Air Force Blue Room if Blue Room rings a bell.

00;39;09;11 - 00;39;39;07
Unknown
Besides Mr. Wood just commenting on it. Remember in my UFO whistleblowers video, Senator Harry Goldwater was denied access to the contents of the Wright-Patterson Blue Room by General Curtis LeMay? I think the government does know I can't back that up, but I think that, at Wright-Patterson Field, if you could get into certain places, you'd find out what the Air Force and the government knows about UFOs.

00;39;39;11 - 00;40;12;24
Unknown
Reportedly, a spaceship landed. It was all hushed up, quiet. Nobody ever. I've never heard about much of it. I called Curtis LeMay, and I said, general, I know we have a room at Wright-Patterson where you put all this secret stuff. Can I go in there? I've never heard him get mad, but he got madder and helped me, cast me out.

00;40;13;00 - 00;40;47;23
Unknown
Said, don't ever ask me that question again. And speaking of General Curtis LeMay. And we have, we have a commendation, from, Curtis LeMay to Harry B Cooper, which is the father of Tim Cooper, where many of these majestic documents came. And for his outstanding work, at the US rf UFO program. So, I mean, I can supply that document, you can put it up on the screen, please see it.

00;40;47;25 - 00;41;42;01
Unknown
So that's another example of, you know, you know, why in the world would Curtis LeMay sign accommodation for somebody for their USAF, program? It just makes no sense if it's not, totally real. I'm just trying to find a copy of it quickly. Yeah. I mean, it's it's hard to hard to read here, but, you know, this is, this is their seal and, accommodation, and it's, to Harry B Cooper, master sergeant distinguished himself by military meritorious service as a noncommissioned officer in charge of printing management branch and noncommissioned officer in charge of camera section publishing division commander, Directorate of Administration of Services, headquarters Air.

00;41;42;02 - 00;42;42;04
Unknown
Air Defense Command. Int'l Air Force Base, Colorado, from 30th September 57 to 1 June 63rd. So he was in an Air Force base between 57 and 63. Looking at photographs of your photos and printing, all sorts of classified documents. And, you know, I think it's Harry's, relationship, to this UFO topic and the friends that he made during that time that allowed, those friends to decide that I want to give stuff to Harry's son, Tim Cooper, and several of the mailbox drops, that had a lot of these documents from the the interplanetary phenomenon unit.

00;42;42;06 - 00;43;09;25
Unknown
Officer or moon dust officer came from back to section 17. Living entities were to be directed solely to op mac BBS zero one. Of course op nav not op. NAC stands for the office of the Chief of Naval Operations. There are some who guess this acronym stands for the Oceanic Platform for the North Atlantic and Caribbean, and that B stands for the Bermuda Biological Station, now called Bios, the Bermuda Institute of Oceanic Sciences.

00;43;09;28 - 00;43;36;04
Unknown
But there's really no proof here. Psalm 101 continues with packaging and shipping protocols for EB e life and states quote, loss of EB life is acceptable and also details in figure four, the extraterrestrial craft referenced earlier in the document. Here we observe classic saucer and triangle shapes, but also the conical shape which closely resembles the 1976 Tehran, Iran UFO case and the cache Landrum case.

00;43;36;06 - 00;44;04;00
Unknown
You know, I'm 54 now. They have the triangle shape. They have the ice cream cone shaped. They got the the cigar shape, the typical saucer shape. But I draw your attention to the triangles and the ice cream cone, which is, you know, famous for the cash. Landrum case. And, triangles are, this is some of the earliest mentions of flying triangles.

00;44;04;03 - 00;44;36;19
Unknown
But anyways, let's circle back to the document control page and analyze the initials well and JRT inside the control page, which is typical of every, highly classified document. This was apparently two points above top secret. According to the document, classifications are different now, and it's pretty much, I believe, an Air Force document. So I went to the Albuquerque phonebook, pulled it up for 1954, 55, 56.

00;44;36;22 - 00;45;11;09
Unknown
I mean, the entries in the change control page spanned from 54 to 57, I believe. And they have the initials. And so I looked in the phone book and found all the initials, and there were, two people below, SR Totten and Captain Lewis, I think, they both lived on Perimeter Road, like 4 or 5 houses from each other inside Kirkland Air Force Base, at the right time.

00;45;11;11 - 00;45;55;15
Unknown
And that's the in the authenticity discussions of on the special operations manual.com website. It's in my book. And I'm working on a new, updated, pamphlet that will have the whole manual and all the authenticity discussion that people can read just easily. So, I found them, and then I hired a private investigator. Wow. To, go find them, and, well, I actually found one guy, one JRT, but he said he's not the right guy.

00;45;55;18 - 00;46;21;04
Unknown
Despite being, there at the right time. And he was the one who lived on the street near, kind of what you found from the phone book at the time near Kirtland. Correct. Well, I didn't go to. So the process is really to go to the Adjutant generals. Listing in government document libraries to find their, their name and serial number.

00;46;21;04 - 00;46;46;11
Unknown
And when you get the serial number, you can get their national personnel records center files. And, and then you can start digging around and try to find these people, and, and I and I found one JRT, which I thought was the right person and went to his house. It took the meeting. I was surprised and pulled out a Fedex envelope with this thing.

00;46;46;11 - 00;47;12;01
Unknown
You know, I'm sure he probably thought I was being CIA or something. And open it up, handed it to him and said, is this you? And he looked at it for a while and looked at the initials and, and said, no. Well I asked him, well what did you do at Kirkland Air Force Base and that I, well I was, I was sort of a psychological counselor or officer.

00;47;12;01 - 00;47;39;23
Unknown
I mean I, you basically sort of hemmed and hawed about what, what he did, but nevertheless, the other private investigator found the, the kids of all the I think it was the I have to look at my notes, but wife or daughter I think was the wife. And apparently he had passed away. Was buried. I think we you was buried in Florida.

00;47;39;26 - 00;48;10;01
Unknown
We we have a grave marker. And and we got platitudes. But you know what? You hire, private investigators there. They can do things that I just find very uncomfortable. They'll just lie to your face all the time. The Legion, they'll they'll they'll squeeze information. All these methods that, you know, I just don't have the skills to do.

00;48;10;03 - 00;48;34;23
Unknown
And so I found that very interesting process. So we did our best to find that. But I would say the smoking gun there is that. Yeah, there's the two, two initials are correct. And they were on the base perimeter road, you know, addresses. And that was just like, oh, boy, that's a really good hallmark for authenticity.

00;48;34;25 - 00;48;57;02
Unknown
That it was real. And, you know, I know you mentioned, John Alexander and his, comments. Maybe you want to set that up and I'll respond. Some of you may be familiar with Colonel John B Alexander, a former U.S. Army colonel whose name has been deeply entwined with ufology and government psionic programs like remote viewing.

00;48;57;05 - 00;49;17;21
Unknown
Not only has Alexander made some outward comments on the MMX 12, so okay, we haven't got time to cover all that. MJ 12 was real, had absolutely nothing to do with UFOs, and if you understand what it was designed for, it was the right kind of people. You don't have to make explanations of how certain people got in.

00;49;17;24 - 00;49;40;15
Unknown
But the people who did know, I mean, I was, in fact, what the thing was at one time I had got rumors of the program, and it was one time that I went to several blind and said, well, what about this thing? And he says, we're not going to discuss that. And it was super, super secret. And parts of it still are and need to stay that way.

00;49;40;17 - 00;50;04;05
Unknown
In his book UFOs, myths, Conspiracies and Reality, Alexander claimed doctor Bob wood told Alexander he believed the Psalm 101 manual to have been created in 1954, with the expressed intention to be leaked to Soviet spies as part of a disinformation campaign. The intent would be to get the Soviets to commit resources to UAP crash recoveries. Well, what does Ryan have to say?

00;50;04;07 - 00;50;35;02
Unknown
Yeah, I mean, I wish I knew what he's up to. I guess I've known John for many, many years. And so's my father. And he he's always wanted to push the envelope and try to squeeze information out of people or trade information. So he has, I mean, he was in Vietnam. He was, special forces colonel operating in Cambodia illegally and all.

00;50;35;02 - 00;51;16;16
Unknown
Maybe on orders, maybe not. So he's had a long history of trying to skirt the, the edge of, legitimacy, in my opinion. And, you know, why did he say this? That it's Russian. Soviet, you know, spycraft, I think it was to curry favor with somebody else. Because it just makes no sense. I mean, there's why would you expose the fact that you've got alien technology that is going to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, nearly 51 Esper, and you got bodies and parts and the whole retrieval program.

00;51;16;19 - 00;51;49;09
Unknown
And why do so much and then leak it? Why wouldn't you just, you know, you could you could, Put it with one of your assets in the Soviet Union and leak it in a much more, responsible, less visible way. And so from a psychological warfare point of view, or worse, I, it just it it doesn't work.

00;51;49;15 - 00;52;18;00
Unknown
It's like you're exposing too much information. There's no need to to create such a fancy document, with such high credibility to, try to scare the Soviets. They have their own crashes. They know it's real. I mean, or China. They, they penetrated the Manhattan Project, you know, within a year, to get the atomic bomb.

00;52;18;00 - 00;52;47;27
Unknown
And I'm sure that they were right on top of the whole, you know, UFO crash UFO thing. So it it doesn't really make much sense in my mind. And the same thing is true with the entire swath of majestic documents. Is it? Why in the world would you try to do something over 19 years with so many documents of so many different, different quality aspects?

00;52;47;29 - 00;53;15;18
Unknown
Some are really, just photocopies, other original documents. So it just if you're trying to scare the living daylights out of some, you know, foreign intelligence agency, it's probably better to, to do something else with all this talk of the Psalm 101. Let's spend some time authenticating the document and spend some time analyzing arguments against the document.

00;53;15;20 - 00;53;42;15
Unknown
Now there is a witness, Navy Yeoman Dale Bailey, who alleges he saw the Psalm 101 manual when he was assisting in the destruction of classified UFO material for an admiral in 1976. Mr. wood is currently in the process of locating files on this witness from his father's archive. So I may have some testimony from this individual soon. Within the words of the document, the woods have noticed many my new details that speak to the manual's authenticity.

00;53;42;18 - 00;54;16;01
Unknown
These include the mention of craft tape when discussing packaging and air materials, not duct tape, which is accurate to 1954 shipping methods, as well as some spelling mechanisms such as screwdriver being two words, which was customary in 1954, the capitalization of first aid, which was changed to lowercase. In the late 50s, the abbreviation of new Mexico as any Mex not N.M., which was altered for ZIP codes, as well as the solo typo in the document in the word desiccant.

00;54;16;03 - 00;54;34;15
Unknown
And there is, of course, the point we touched on earlier, the raising of the letter Z, which indicated the usage of a hot led press. Many detractors to the document like to point to the cover page and usage of variable font and drop shadow font, but we can find other Army field manuals from this time period using the same styling.

00;54;34;17 - 00;55;00;04
Unknown
Odd fonts had also been used in various documents like this. October 24th, 1952 memo initiating the NSA under the Truman administration blocked epistemology has theorized the usage of fonts was actually experiments done by Doctor Vannevar Bush, who actually experimented with fonts such as pictured here in a Popular Mechanics magazine where we can see Bush operating a novel photo typesetting machine out of e.g. in 1950.

00;55;00;06 - 00;55;28;26
Unknown
Bush even led the design of the cryptographic machinery used by the NSA's predecessor, OP 20. Skeptics of the memo additionally like to point out a restricted classification on the memo's cover page and how the memo cannot be both top secret and restricted. Since restricted classification falls below confidential and top secret, this is a misunderstood point. According to the 1947 Atomic Energy Act, information on atomic energy is born, classified even if not created by USG.

00;55;28;26 - 00;55;53;21
Unknown
Elements. In situations such as these, restricted data is not a level of classification. A document containing restricted data can also be classified as secret or top secret. The Psalm one was also written during the time that the restricted classification level was phased out of USG to confidential, so we can find articles during this time about an extended changeover period due to some issues.

00;55;53;24 - 00;56;28;15
Unknown
Additionally, skeptics point out the fact that area 51 S4, as highlighted in the classification table, did not exist in 1954, and this is a very important point to address. Yeah, well, and we found a, a newspaper article in 51, basically, contractors are pissed off that, there was this huge government contract awarded to a competitor for hundreds of millions of dollars for, for concrete out in area 51.

00;56;28;18 - 00;57;04;18
Unknown
And there they're fighting back and forth in the newspaper in 51. And the other thing is it was Groom Lake. There was a mine, the Groom Lake mine, which was a borax mine there already, that could have been exploited, to be enhanced, for an underground facility, as well, that could still be researched further, to find out from the mining department and the historical records of, well, how big was this underground borax mine?

00;57;04;18 - 00;57;44;03
Unknown
How many millions of square feet is it? Or was it, where precisely is it? So you could dig further to provide further evidence there. But yeah, clearly it it was started in 51. And, and it's I'm sure started small. I strongly recommend reading Jan Aldrich's 1996 criticism of the Special Operations Manual. Aldrich's primary criticisms of the manual revolve around what it doesn't include, such as instructions to tell recovery teams to set up a grid, photograph the scene, and tag each item for future reference.

00;57;44;05 - 00;58;11;03
Unknown
Aldrich also criticizes the use of downed satellites, which in 1954 was before the time of Sputnik. The use of the word satellite has been utilized commonly during this time period in literature to discuss space debris. I find much of his criticisms to be fluff, such as problems with interchanging the phrases MJ 12, magic 12 and majestic 12 throughout the document, and can't help but to feel that Aldrich Cherry picked his argument surrounding what is not instructed at the recovery teams.

00;58;11;03 - 00;58;37;11
Unknown
However, I do think his criticisms are important to understand when reading the document. If you want to read more, Ryan and Doctor Bob have a massive section on their website. Special Operations manual.com authenticating the Psalm 101. I highly recommend reading this for a more of a deep dive into authenticating the manual. The article explores more into the provenance of the document, including analyzing the anonymous store in Wisconsin where the film was mailed.

00;58;37;19 - 00;59;10;00
Unknown
With all of this discussion around the Psalm 101, I found it important to touch on the legitimacy of other majestic documents, especially those that have been found in avenues such as the National Archives. Ryan had many more to reference. There was the Cutler Twining memo. This is, Bob Cutler, Robert Cutler to, to the national security, Council, and it says NSA, NSC, MJ 12 Special studies Group in 1954.

00;59;10;00 - 00;59;50;27
Unknown
So it doesn't say majestic, but it says MJ 12 special studies, group and his original onion skin. It's in the, Library of Congress manuscript Division, in downtown Washington. So there's other documents. Two. There's one at College Park. In Maryland from the Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency, which is sort of part of paperclip that says, CIA, MJ 12, on the bottom of a memo for, Project Paperclip.

00;59;50;29 - 01;00;28;22
Unknown
Project 63, I think so. But anyway, there's a couple of examples and then there's acknowledgment as I mentioned earlier, that this interplanetary phenomenon, union exists, as well. So. It's not like there's no evidence from the National Archives, let alone all the other stuff. You know, all the other UFO project sign, Project Grudge. And all that research, of course, with Ross, Cold Hearts, new reality check program interest in JFK and the majestic document is at an all time high.

01;00;28;22 - 01;00;59;19
Unknown
And I was super keen to explore this avenue. I think it's in the interplanetary phenomenon unit one, where they say that, Kennedy was given, some information or believed to have gotten information from somebody in Congress, while he was, before he was elected president. So he, Kennedy was aware of it, according to the documents of, of this topic.

01;00;59;22 - 01;01;37;28
Unknown
And it's it's importance, there's also national security action memorandums. Like a week before he's assassinated, where he says to, James Webb, the head of NASA. I want you to share with the Russians the knowns and the unknowns. And by implication, that means, you know, open the camera and tell the Soviets all about UFOs and there's lots of reasons why Kennedy would be assassinated.

01;01;38;01 - 01;02;11;24
Unknown
But here's another. One reason is that you might have told the truth or pushed harder on, cooperation with the Soviets. I mean, particularly after his, you know, Bay of pigs. You know, showdown. He didn't want that to happen again. The connection with JFK and MJ 12 does not stop here. Within the majestic documents lies a written, typed NSA intercept of JFK's hotline, talking to the Premier about the UFO situation and national security implications.

01;02;11;26 - 01;02;37;25
Unknown
JFK is also mentioned within another set of documents wood considers to have the highest authenticity rating, the burned memo. In June of 1999, UFO researcher Tim Cooper received an anonymous letter from a source claiming to be a CIA counter-intelligence officer with documents that would connect MJ 12 to JFK's murder. The source commended Cooper on his decision to have worked with doctor Bob on the majestic files.

01;02;37;27 - 01;03;03;00
Unknown
The files included by the source claimed to have been some of the last surviving paper, MJ 12 documents, after a special classified executive order from Nixon ordered all MJ 12 documents to be destroyed and moved on to computers. The burned memo was allegedly snatched from a fire before being destroyed and is, unlike most documents, original paper. This memo is from MJ one aka the Director of Central Intelligence.

01;03;03;02 - 01;03;30;14
Unknown
The memo is directed to MJ two through seven in reference to Project Majestic in Jehovah of Vro, Parasite and PA Helion. Quote. As you must know, Lancer Codeword for JFK has made some inquiries regarding our activities which we cannot allow. End quote. We can also find a 1961 document allegedly sent by JFK to the director of the CIA, requesting an update on the psychological warfare plans related to the majestic 12.

01;03;30;19 - 01;04;02;05
Unknown
And here is a very interesting additional point. In 2023, President Biden ordered some documents from the JFK investigation be released. One name of note within these documents was CIA agent Reuben Ephron, who was intercepting Lee Harvey Oswald mail in the months before his assassination. I do find it a bit strange. The October 15th, 1955 Central Intelligence Bulletin listed operative Reuben Ephron, as well as three other USG or U.S. military personnel, as witnessing disc like UFOs.

01;04;02;05 - 01;04;22;00
Unknown
When traveling by a train in the Caspian Sea, there are hundreds of majestic documents, and the words have implemented a really quality scale to gauge the authenticity of these documents. So of course, with so many documents from so many sources over so many years, I was encouraged to ask Mr. Wood if there were any documents he suspects are forgeries.

01;04;22;02 - 01;04;48;23
Unknown
Yeah, that's that's a good comment. At this point, I don't have any information that any document that's, listed on the website is fake. I have no credible evidence that, it's it's genuinely faked. I mean, so you to fake something, you have to have really. What's the specific why did you fake it? Who did you launch it against?

01;04;48;23 - 01;05;19;20
Unknown
A specific target? In in intelligence. Are you trying to mess with the UFO community? Why bother? The general attitude of the intelligence community, of the people that control this secret is to ignore, everything and provide no additional confirmation, or evidence. They just try to manage the leaks and discredit people. So that's the methodology, for managing the leak.

01;05;19;20 - 01;05;42;13
Unknown
So I would say at this time, I have no evidence that, anything has been faked. Now, I've got lots of documents where you can't do anything more like, the Aquarius document that came out in the Carter, was allegedly signed by Carter. Yeah, I wanted to bring that up. That was brought forth by UFO researcher Lee Graham.

01;05;42;13 - 01;06;16;12
Unknown
The, Aquarius document package. Can you talk about that and describe it a little bit, along with kind of your feelings on it? Yeah. I mean, it's sort of, fluff in my mind. I mean, it's informed fluff, but there's nothing to check. There's not that there's not enough specifics. This to validate or check anything. And it just seems odd that, you know, a document like this would be devoid of specifics.

01;06;16;12 - 01;06;40;14
Unknown
Maybe they wanted to ensure that there weren't any specifics. They were checkable. But that's the part that's that's troubling, and you can't check it so you don't know what to do with it. So that's why it's in the Stan Friedman calls the gray basket, or I call the neutral basket, where, I need more evidence to push it down or up.

01;06;40;16 - 01;07;10;19
Unknown
As we know, the majestic documents were leaked during the 1984 to 1999 era. This time was post, Robertson Panel and Condon Committee, where public interest in UFOs were at a relatively low. Only behind the scenes in the 70s, where researchers like Leonard Stringfield doing serious research on crash retrievals with the majority of the documents dating back to the 40s and 50s, I asked Mr. Wood why he thought the leaks occurred when they did, but it was really about,

01;07;10;21 - 01;07;33;29
Unknown
Vannevar Bush writing to Eisenhower, saying, you know, we have all these celestial gifts, of crashed UFOs and and we really ought to do something about it. And he said, be quiet, go win the war. And, come back to me later. And when Roswell happened, they actually pushed at it and started this organization. So who who leaked it and why?

01;07;34;02 - 01;08;05;21
Unknown
Well, again, there's multiple sources and we don't really know, but we know that there was two film drops in 84 and 94. Those may have been the same people. But maybe not in two different people. The certain method of delivery and in undeveloped film was the same. And then there was, several, mailings from, Sacramento, California.

01;08;05;24 - 01;08;51;20
Unknown
There was, several mailbox drops, some physically put in Tim Cooper's mailbox without postage. It's like somebody went into the mail room where I was a member of the post office and put it in his mailbox or cracked his code at the top and stuck it in, and then there was some mailings, for example, from the Freedom of Information Act office at Fort Meade, Maryland, and that came physically mailed the, the Encyclopedia of Flying Saucers, which is, original London skin.

01;08;51;22 - 01;09;25;29
Unknown
And then there was, a couple of different documents that were they had this dash one and two in the upper corner on every page. And, and ultimately, Thomas Cantwell, wrote a letter, at the time of his death or near the time of his death, to to Tim Cooper. You know, it basically said, you know, here, Tim, by the time you get this letter reaches, you will I will left this world.

01;09;26;01 - 01;10;15;29
Unknown
So he's dying of cancer. And he goes on to, describe, you know, his relationship with Stringfield and Friedman and, intelligence contacts at Fort Meade, Maryland. Roswell. And, and and then has a sketch, of of a craft, that, you know, he sort of drew as the Roswell craft, and then we also had another, letter from Salina, which is allegedly the the daughter of, Thomas Cantwell.

01;10;16;02 - 01;10;52;27
Unknown
Or can't we all, which is a pseudonym. You know, it's not his real name, right. So, but he, he worked, allegedly at the Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit and, probably was a SS officer, in that time frame and, you know, you don't know what he what he died of other in cancer, but, so that's sort of the the broad brush of the sources of, of materials, and there's so many names.

01;10;52;27 - 01;11;25;09
Unknown
I mean, on the Majestic documents.com website, there's, you dig around, there's a personnel, the master list, right, master, personnel data list. And, I'd urge everybody to file off your Freedom Information Act requests to the CIA and the NSA and the Air Force and Air Force Office special investigations, and try to dig up more information, and more FBI files on those those people and individuals or go to the National Archives.

01;11;25;11 - 01;11;50;02
Unknown
So there's loads of research to be done. It's just you got to pay people to do it, right. But this is the limited bandwidth. Everybody in ufology sort of has this, you know, peak of enthusiasm, and then it wanes and then you sort of have the trough of disillusionment. And then if you keep going, you keep learning more.

01;11;50;04 - 01;12;32;14
Unknown
It's a complicated world. The mention of can't we all sometimes mistaken as Cantwell here, gives us a great opportunity to analyze what we know about the majestic document leaks and their sources. There are three major sources of document leaks. One can't leel who supplied much of the material. We've covered today to Tim Cooper, such as the Epub Report and Field Order, Harlan Coder Magic Memo, first Annual Report and the JFK to director of the CIA documents Selena, the alleged daughter of can't we'll supplied Cooper with ten short memos alongside documents like the Twining White Hot Report, Eisenhower to Oppenheimer Memo and Directive from Twining to Truman.

01;12;32;16 - 01;12;55;03
Unknown
And lastly, we have source one who supplied the burned memo we spoke about earlier in his letter to Cooper. Thomas Cantwell took ownership for many of the mailbox. Majestic document drops. Starting in 1992, Timothy Cooper investigated Mr. Cantwell and legally bound his findings in a five page affidavit distributed to Stanton Friedman and Doctor Bob wood that can be found on Majestic Documents.

01;12;55;03 - 01;13;26;27
Unknown
Dot com information obtained by Cooper and shared with Stanton and Bob include claims of cartwheels. Background. Cantwell himself stated to be part of the, quote, Counterintelligence Corps CIC Scientific and Technical Branch, Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit from 1942 to 1958. According to Cantwell, he served in the CIC until 1980 and worked for CIA covert operations in the 60s and had contacts with the FBI, KGB, and GRU.

01;13;26;29 - 01;14;10;09
Unknown
He claimed to have retired as lieutenant colonel and been involved with the majestic community, Match.com and the Super secret 5412 group. End quote. Well-respected Reddit user Harry is white hot has spearheaded an investigation into identifying this mysterious Cantwell, so credit for his amazing work. Harry has proposed the idea for why CIA operative Boris Dmitri Tarasov is the man behind the enigmatic Thomas Cantwell Tarasov CIA career spanned between 1956 and 1968 after immigrating to the US from Russia, where his Russian language abilities proved invaluable to U.S. intelligence agencies, his U.S. Army records from the Counterintelligence Corps range from 1942 to 1945 were.

01;14;10;09 - 01;14;33;29
Unknown
Tarasov then left the CIC to work for the Red Cross in Cleveland, Ohio. Harry wisely points out this Red cross work likely is a cover story for work on the IP you stationed out of Wright Field, which is located in northern Ohio near Cleveland. Wright field also house the Army Air Materiel Command, where General Nathan Twining alleged majestic 12 member was stationed.

01;14;34;02 - 01;15;04;06
Unknown
It's worth mentioning during his time at the American National Red cross, Tarasov was employed for building maintenance engineering under a social agency. One must ask why a counterintelligence operator tasked with, quote, detailed composition of the foreign armies and their intelligence services, approach and interrogation of the enemy military personnel and civilian detection and prevention of the acts of sabotage and, quote, would leave for a social agency four years into their career before rejoining the CIA.

01;15;04;08 - 01;15;30;08
Unknown
Interesting connection here as well. In Cooper's description of Cantwell, he states while Cantwell was part of the CIA and CIC, he interrogated agents in West Germany. We can see onto Roth's office official record. In 1945, the agent attended the advanced CIC School in Ober Urself, Germany, where he was tasked with, quote, extracting the necessary information from the enemy population, military and members of the Nazi Party, and quote.

01;15;30;11 - 01;15;57;14
Unknown
In his analysis of Cantwell, Cooper also states Cantwell served as U.S. Army Intelligence in Washington, DC from 42 to 45. Well, we can find. Tarasov attended the Military Intelligence Training Center and performed CIC work at Camp Ritchie, Maryland, a mere 70 miles from DC, in the year of 1945. At the time of Cooper sharing his investigation with Friedman, and would, he believed Cantwell to be living in California and to be in his 90s.

01;15;57;16 - 01;16;21;06
Unknown
We can find no obituary for Tarasov, but at the time of this personal history statement titled CIA Historical Review Program released as sanitized, released in 1998, just two years removed from Cooper's investigation, Tarasov was indeed living in San Leandro, California. Born in 1908, this would have made Tarasov 88 at the time of Cooper's investigation if he was still alive.

01;16;21;06 - 01;16;47;00
Unknown
When Cooper received his letter. This rabbit hole goes much deeper, with Tarasov being stationed in 1963 as a translator operations officer in Mexico City, transcribing and translating some agency surveillance traffic from communist aligned embassies and other specific targets to Soros. Work was used as evidence to prove that Lee Harvey Oswald visited Soviet compound. So, of course, to Soros work dovetails into the JFK assassination.

01;16;47;07 - 01;17;16;18
Unknown
I personally have my own theory on the concentration of these documents as we see the majority of information collected on the majestic 12 as a snapshot in time in the 40s and 50s, I draw your attention to the 1954 Atomic Energy Agreement. As mentioned in the 2024 and 2025 Schumer legislation, which states NASA craft materials and bodies, as well as UAP and legacy program information were hushed away as trans classified foreign nuclear materials.

01;17;16;20 - 01;17;44;15
Unknown
I find it interesting after the Psalm 101, which was released in 1954, most majestic documents dated after 54 contain nowhere near the detail on program operations. Scope and purpose. Perhaps the 54 AEC agreement oversaw a drastic shift in 12 records. I relayed this theory to Mr. Wood, and he shared the same sentiment. That's absolutely true. I think that's when it it sort of happened.

01;17;44;17 - 01;18;08;05
Unknown
And, and that's maybe why we got the special operations manual is that, you know, the, the Air Force officers that were responsible for this basically got the rug pulled out of them, said, no, no, no, you guys don't get to do this anymore. It's going someplace else. And people were pissed and this guy took it and decided at some point it was going to leak it.

01;18;08;08 - 01;18;39;05
Unknown
Mr. wood and myself circled back to the personnel list I touched on earlier in the video with some of the original members named in the MG 12. I asked Mr. Wood about names associated with the majestic 12 that have been overlooked or forgotten about. Yeah, I mean, it's, in the white hot report. It's mentioned that, it was really Forrestal and, Bush that the came together and said, we need to form this top secret research and development intelligence gathering organization.

01;18;39;12 - 01;19;11;06
Unknown
And I think it's also mentioned right there on the, the, front couple pages of the Special Operations manual, the history of the group, where it talks about, special classified presidential order, and, James before Saul Stalin, Vannevar Bush, you know, formed the group or recommended to the president to do that. Now, first of all, you know, he had a little bit of a drinking problem.

01;19;11;09 - 01;19;37;26
Unknown
And he was very much of the attitude that we need to be more open, and potentially discuss this with more people. I don't know if he was all the way to go public, but, he was, thrown out the 75th. Well, throughout, top floor of Bethesda is Naval Hospital or fell out the floor or something.

01;19;37;29 - 01;20;03;16
Unknown
He fantas rated, as they say, although I don't think it was windows. It was the bars. But anyway, he he lost his life over that. And, and actually in one of the majestic documents, he says it's even necessary. Regrettable that, Forrestal had to lose his life. And and my book, Magic Eyes Only, there's a dedication to those that have lost their lives for the sake of UFO secrecy.

01;20;03;16 - 01;20;25;09
Unknown
And Forrestal is clearly one person that he lost his life, that sake of secrecy. So outside of Bush and Forrestal, are there any kind of names that you think, as you were talking about how the majestic documents in the master list needs further investigation? Are there any names that you think are absolutely crucial to study and or have kind of been looked over and forgotten about me?

01;20;25;11 - 01;20;58;28
Unknown
Yeah, I think so. There is, the white hot report, which is, you know, it's basically this is the group that went to Roswell and did a bunch of analysis and worked all over the summer to create this report, in September. So it happened in July. And this was everybody went crazy and investigated, and wrote up this report, and presented it to the president and others.

01;20;59;01 - 01;21;28;08
Unknown
And there's the members of the mission. You know, there's people like Captain Charles Buchanan. Who the hell is he? I still haven't found him. And what's his military personnel record file like? Or, Robert Ginsberg, Colonel Robert Ginsberg or Captain Richard Glass or. I mean, Carl Hummel sign is a big, well known person. Major General Steven Chamberlain, assistant chief of staff for intelligence.

01;21;28;08 - 01;22;00;07
Unknown
He was certainly unknown to, you know, Major George McDonald. That was his Chamberlain's boss. He was you know, he was like the, chief of staff of the Air Force. Admiral Paul Lee, he is very well known. Leslie Groves, head of the Manhattan Project. He was he had all his team members there. James Ley, jr the Thomas Lynch was the finance guy in the Treasury Department.

01;22;00;09 - 01;22;35;12
Unknown
So they had, you know, they got Navy and Air Force and, finance people and as well as, you know, von Karman and Oppenheimer and Doolittle, James Doolittle and that's Reinstein. So there's loads I mean, that's just one document where you could dig in to the next level. You could write a whole book on just that one document and all the interconnection and the validations of every single sentence and every single linkage between people and their correspondence.

01;22;35;12 - 01;23;01;08
Unknown
It's a huge amount of work. I mean, I'd, I'd love to give somebody, here's 50 grand. I want you to go write a whole book on this one topic and go spend a year researching. And as I mentioned before, we really do observe the majestic 12. It's a snapshot in time myself, and I'm sure every viewer of this video wonders about the evolution of the alleged group, how they operate today, and if in 2024 there is still a group known as the majestic 12.

01;23;01;11 - 01;23;29;24
Unknown
So the documents sort of in the history point of view or stop in the mid 50s or so, with the fifth annual report on, on majestic. And I suspect that it's probably still has the same name. It's such a rare club, you know, to lose that history and change the name seems silly, but they could do it.

01;23;29;27 - 01;24;19;13
Unknown
And there's probably certainly a lot of, sub classifications and different groups that are focused on. So hardware or bodies, those are obvious bifurcations of classification. But then probably within each of those there's probably additional classifications to compartmentalize it and get it into, buckets where they could potentially work with private corporations or other organizations. But, you know, in my mind, it's it's the Aerospace Corporation and the Carlyle Group, and E g and G, and some of the, the historic ones, I mean, Rand, for example, is up to their eyeballs in this stuff.

01;24;19;16 - 01;25;04;15
Unknown
Yeah. And there's probably a lot of them that have done research historically. We have heard so much from Ryan about his involvement with the majestic 12. But another key player is his father, Doctor Robert Wood. Why did doctor Bob, a rocket scientist, get involved with UFOs and the majestic documents? It was maybe 67 or so or 1967 where he started reading a bunch of UFO books and convinced his management that, we going to figure out how the UFOs work before or after Lockheed does, and they he said, well, how much money you want to try to work on that bomb?

01;25;04;17 - 01;25;38;12
Unknown
And so he spent internal R&D, Douglas Aircraft Company money and then, then the merger happened, to McDonnell Douglas. But so for a couple of years, they spent the equivalent of $4.5 million working on, gravity. Experiments, theory. They interviewed abductees. I mean, I remember is, you know, a little boy, you know, 13, 14 going out to the Mojave Desert.

01;25;38;14 - 01;26;06;12
Unknown
And, one of his engineers was out there, with the magnetometer and strip chart recorders, and they had anomalous events. And sleeping on this couch in this, you know, high heat in the desert. And, it was fun for for a kid at the time. So that was that was his work. They didn't have any access to classified information.

01;26;06;14 - 01;26;54;26
Unknown
But that was the start of his, deep, interest in, in UFOs. And actually, he hired Stan Freedman to work for him. And look at the nuclear physics aspect of, of UFO propulsion. Viewers of my channel were. Remember Project Moondust, unofficial group proposed in 1961 by the US Air Force alongside Project Blue Fly and UFO Moondust was tasked to quote, locate, recover and deliver descended foreign space vehicles and quote, Moondust counterpart Blue Fly served to quote, facilitate expeditious delivery to foreign technology, division of moon dust or other items of great technological intelligence interest and quote in my video on Moon dust, we covered a variety of fascinating cases occurring in Nepal,

01;26;54;26 - 01;27;21;20
Unknown
Afghanistan, Canada, and a 1965 case in the Congo with an accompanying memo titled fragment Metal recovered in the Republic of the Congo. Origin. Believed to be an unidentified flying object, Moondust does indeed have connection to the majestic documents. In a fascinating original document called the Bo in manuscript. Oh, yeah. I mean, but Moondust is definitely a recovery organization.

01;27;21;20 - 01;27;49;21
Unknown
I mean, space junk primarily, but, occasionally it's, you know, down saucers. And so if if there's some obvious evidence that it's a saucer, they may have a different team that goes. But the moon dust people were very much, involved, in. So that's logical that they would do that. I guess I wanted to bring up one final thought for you.

01;27;49;27 - 01;28;14;15
Unknown
Is that many people say, oh, these are all photocopies. And, and I guess I just wanted to highlight, you know, one of the leaked ones, yeah. Well, sent from Fort Meade from Freedom of Information Act office was was this one, top secret magic? This is original onion skin.

01;28;14;17 - 01;28;43;06
Unknown
Paper that we've done forensic analysis on, and for ink and, pencil marks. And it has comments by Vannevar Bush, and it has hints of. We have anti-gravity craft in, you know, 1960s, the Encyclopedia of Flying Saucers, the, the Boeing manuscript. And actually, there's a book that, it's on Amazon called The Encyclopedia Flying Saucers by Vernon Bowen.

01;28;43;09 - 01;29;25;14
Unknown
Who who wrote it and it's, it's very well done. History of UFO cases from 1960 and before. So that's when, he typed it, said into the Air Force and never got it back until, 39 years later. Wow. And the document has comments from Vannevar Bush. Yeah. It's. You guys made it. Yeah. It's like, but this this comments in pen marginalia and in pen and ink, ink marks like, you know, what is Don Menzel doing, question mark, in relation to these comments in the topic?

01;29;25;17 - 01;30;10;10
Unknown
And then, another one was in relation to, could these craft PR man made, you know, experimental vehicles and handwritten on the side in ink is this should not get out, implying in my mind that the theory of deep concern that we're got gravity control craft. And so that's, that's juicy. My research and my father's research on the majestic documents is, rich and robust and highly supportive of their authenticity and credibility.

01;30;10;13 - 01;30;37;07
Unknown
And I welcome objections to it. And if you have some, it's fake because, statement or, I don't like it because I'm all ears. But I've not found any credible objections. All right. Thank you so much, Mr. Wood. Thank you. What's up guys? Thank you so much for joining me into this investigation and documentary on the majestic 12 and majestic documents.

01;30;37;09 - 01;31;00;10
Unknown
Before I get into my usual ramblings, at the end of every video, I need to say a couple of things one. Thank you, Mr. Ryan Wood. Thank you for sitting down with me doing this interview, answering hours of questions and emails and the majestic documents. The majestic 12, me requesting additional files, me requesting images, and so forth. This man is truly of incredible character and I am so thankful.

01;31;00;10 - 01;31;24;04
Unknown
One of my biggest inspirations in the field of Ufology agreed to sit down with me and cover the majestic documents for anybody who has watched a single one of my videos, you know I reference this book, Magic Eyes Only as the greatest book I have ever read on UFO Crash Retrievals by Ryan Wood. I highly encourage anybody to purchase this book because it also covers much of the majestic 12, including the authenticating of the Special Operations Manual.

01;31;24;06 - 01;31;49;11
Unknown
It also includes a full copy of the Special Operations Manual. Third, Ryan Wood has a beautiful tool I don't see referenced much. This is a website called UFO Dec's UFO. Com what this is Ryan Eastwood trained a ChatGPT model and scanned in between 500 and 800 UFO books. You can submit a question on any topic in ufology and receive an answer from Mr. Wood.

01;31;49;13 - 01;32;10;07
Unknown
I myself have used this tool dozens of times, and I've used it in a lot of my past research, such as referencing the 1974 Koyama case discussing a certain private corporation I'm going to cover soon, and I even asked it about underwater bases that I might inhabit after reading and hearing about some parts of Lou Elizondo new statements.

01;32;10;09 - 01;32;30;09
Unknown
So thank you, Mr. Wood. Please get a copy of Magic Eyes Only. Please go to Majestic documents.com where you can read all 33 or 35 of the reports I reference today in depth, of course, with, YouTube video descriptions, it's a little too tough to include all links, especially when I have between 50 and 60 research files. So you'll look in the video description.

01;32;30;09 - 01;32;45;27
Unknown
You will see every document we covered today, which is over 30. You'll find the exact name. Go to Majestic documents.com. Punch that in, copy and paste it. Review the document while watching the video. I think that's really important. When we're discussing a document, you can have it on another monitor and part of your screen kind of read through what we're going through.

01;32;45;27 - 01;33;14;06
Unknown
You know me, I like to cite my work. So all of these documents will be available for you to read super easily. Okay, onto my ramblings. The majestic 12 has consumed my life for the past couple of weeks, to the point where I have not even touched this and this is going to be my next reading. I cannot wait to dive in, but I highly recommend anybody get the Majestic Air Magic Eyes Only book and a book I referenced multiple times in the video, Top Secret Magic by Stan Friedman.

01;33;14;08 - 01;33;34;05
Unknown
If you want to learn more into the authentication of the Eisenhower briefing document. Cutler Twining memo Truman Forrestal memo, this is the book for you. It was written in the 90s, but this is a beautiful piece that's so useful to investigate more into what we've been talking about today. Stanton Friedman is a legend amongst Ryan Wood. Robert Wood.

01;33;34;05 - 01;33;53;06
Unknown
So please check out this book if you want to learn more. It's fantastic. So now we can get on to some of my thoughts. Anybody who's watch my videos knows more and more over time I've been referencing the majestic documents. A perfect example is my last video, the 1974 Koyama Crash Retrieval. I referenced the first annual Majestic report as well as the IPU report.

Before that, in my 1955 tech crash video near Del Rio, Texas, I referenced the Eisenhower briefing document in the 1950 crash listed there, also touched on by Lou Elizondo to have occurred near El Indio in Guerrero. I made some statements public that I thought that the majestic 12 was likely a real organization, and the majestic files had probably been a mix of information and disinformation.

At that time. I had not spent the amount of time I have now pouring through the documents, looking at connections, looking at research, and just immersing myself in so much time. I think the majestic 12 encompasses so much more than what I initially suspected. What really took me by surprise was the amount of length behind authenticating the Eisenhower Briefing Document and Special Operations manual.

Those, of course, are two of the big heavy hitters. We talk about this in this stock in this video. But towards the end of the video, you'll remember the Boeing manuscript. And you remember how, the author, Boeing, I can't remember his first name, sent this in to the Department of Defense in 1960 to get it reviewed. He never got a copy back.

It wasn't until 1999 Timothy Cooper got this, from a FOIA designation, Fort Meade, with comments all over it from Vannevar Bush and stamped top Secret magic. Now, of course, we discussed how this referenced Moondust, that Vannevar Bush made comments on, anti-gravity vehicles. But this the discussion of moon dust and insect like beans reminded me so much of Doctor SA Baker.

And of course, I discussed that video Doctor Star Baker multiple times. But we have to remember that within the Majestic Files one if not the key player is Doctor Vannevar Bush. Of course, the beginning of the majestic leaks occurred in 1980. But the thing is, we can trace Doctor Robert Star Baker discussing Vannevar Bush directing UFO study in the U.S. government as far back as 1950, around the time of the alleged MJ 12 connection.

01;35;55;24 - 01;36;15;26

So I never thought the Star Baker connections would go so deep here. Remember Doctor Starbuck, or even when talking to, Stanton Freeman Namedrop Doctor Eric Walker. Doctor Eric Walker himself confirmed to know of the MJ 12 existence and to say it's real, along with a really interesting quote, that reminded me of Don Quixote, chasing at windmills.

Perhaps what he meant by this is you might have the majestic documents, because I believe this, interview came out in the mid to late 80s. Sweden have all the majestic documents. I think that he may have meant you might have these majestic documents. You may be able to read them, but you will never get to the bottom of it.

It's futile to try and fully grasp the extent of the majestic files. And speaking of Doctor Eric Walker, what really interests me thinking about now is how his claims about ESP, getting into the program and so forth. So that was just fascinating to me, the connections with Starbuck, because remember Starbuck, who described insect like beings as well in the Encyclopedia Flying Saucers, Vannevar Bush underlining these subjects, is so fascinated.

And let's not forget, at the end of the 14 page sample provided on majestic Documents, Dot com, there's a section talking about Mussolini and Hitler, being exposed to some sort of craft in 1942. Vannevar Bush underlines this as well. Almost underlines a whole paragraph. This brings my mind back to the 1933 magenta, Italy case. Anybody else?

01;37;17;12 - 01;37;36;29

It's just it's really fascinating. Some of the other, documents that really interest me, of course, of the IPU report, nine pages, talks about the Sandia lab technicians, talks about the crew at Roswell. So much of these documents kind of focus around Roswell, right? I think there's so much more work to be done on the JFK assassination and MJ 12.

01;37;36;29 - 01;37;54;28

So much more work to be done on forest death and the MJ 12, because that's very interesting. I think many people, think of a conspiracy around forest death as well, throwing himself out the 13th story of a of a naval hospital room. So there's so much more work to be done there, and there's so much more work to be done on the majestic documents in general.

Right. As Mr. Wood has said, much of these documents, as he likes to say, are onion skin, where we have original copies. In fact, I'd say that's the minority of the reports. Many of them are facts from tri x film. Photocopies and so forth. So there's some provenance work that can't be done on these documents, like Mr. Wood has done with the bone manuscript, actually dating the ink back to 1962, of when Vannevar Bush wrote Moondust on the paper.

01;38;22;05 - 01;38;47;18

So I think if we look at the majestic 12, we can't argue for the validity of all of these documents. But I think it is a safe line of research to kind of understand the majestic 12 likely was a likely was and possibly is a real group tasked with the study material exploitation and reverse engineering and crash retrieval of UFOs.

How that looks today, I would reckon it involves much more of a private sector. As beautiful as it is with the SA Baker video, we get to see a snapshot of the early days of UFO crash retrieval, and I think the majestic documents are the perfect example of really investigating the early days, the early players, the early organization, and the early procedures of UFO crash retrieval.

She had to get this for me and that is the best gift I've ever had. So of course I change the camera a little bit as you see, so you can get that in full view coming down the line. We got a lot of great projects, guys. I know this one took a little time. I really wanted to get this right.
