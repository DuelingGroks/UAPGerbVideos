So let's start from the very beginning. You say it's a 90 year cover up. Just about. Yeah 90 years. 1933 was the first recovery in Europe in magenta Italy. They recovered partially intact vehicle. It's true. It's real. Yeah. That actually happened. Italian government moved it to a secure, airbase in Italy for the rest of kind of the fascist regime until 1944, 1945.

00;00;30;29 - 00;00;59;21
Unknown
And, you know, the Pope Pius the 12th back channeled that. So the Vatican was involved. Yeah. And told the Americans what the Italians had, and we ended up scooping it. So let me be very clear about this. You're saying that the Catholic Church, the Vatican, they know about the existence of non-human intelligence on this planet. Certainly it didn't start or end with Roswell, the first traceable recovery of a UFO occurred 14 years before the infamous cover up in the desert sands of Nevada.

00;00;59;27 - 00;01;26;03
Unknown
In fact, indirect statements made by both David Grush and Lou Elizondo, the first night craft to be forcibly taken by US forces, would arise from the smoldering remains of the Italian fascist state, led by none other than Benito Mussolini during the Second World War. Hey guys, it's UAP Group and today we are going to discuss the now infamous 1933 magenta, Italy UFO crash retrieval.

00;01;26;06 - 00;01;50;25
Unknown
This tale is both intriguing and perplexing, featuring a rich document trail and fascinating historical connections to the regime of Mussolini and the Vatican. Why did Grush specifically reference this case to Ross Coltart in his News Nation article? Buckle up guys, because today we are going to dive right into the magenta UFO retrieval.

00;01;50;27 - 00;02;16;11
Unknown
Before we do any sort of investigation, let's discuss the story. And guys, please forgive any butchering of Italian words or names that I use. In June of 1933, 14 years before the Roswell crash, an unknown craft crashed or landed at magenta, just west of Milan, Italy. The craft was reported to be bell like, almost resembling a mix between a flying saucer and the clock.

00;02;16;14 - 00;02;43;16
Unknown
The legendary mythical alleged Nazi wonder weapon. The craft sat at a reported ten meters in diameter. Dictator Benito Mussolini thought this was an unconventional flying vehicle that originated from France, Britain or Germany. But the Italian government established a top secret group that Neto Ricciardi specialized a 33, or how I'll refer to it from now on. So you don't make me say that again.

00;02;43;18 - 00;03;18;29
Unknown
The Rs 33 to examine the craft. This top secret group was actually headed by Prime Minister Benito Mussolini and Foreign Minister Galeazzo Ciano. Air Marshal Italo Balbo was scientific support from astronomer Gino Saxony, and possibly senator and founder of the radio Guglielmo Marconi. Marconi himself initially resisted Mussolini's terrestrial claims, believing the craft to be extraterrestrial in origin. The craft and its debris was reportedly stored in the hangars of the SII marchetti aircraft Company in Virginia.

00;03;19;01 - 00;04;07;21
Unknown
Various journalists were ordered to keep silent about the incident due to national security, citing strict dissemination of information by the agentes to Funny Italy's state propaganda papers. The UFO remained in the possession of Mussolini's regime until the fall of the axis powers, and was recovered by US agents of the Office of Strategic Services in 1944 or 1945, and this was the former US intelligence agency, the Magenta case was brought to light by Italian UFO researcher Roberto Pinot, who in 1996 received original Italian secret documents from the fascist regime containing both protocol on how to handle the craft discovery, as well as internal Italian government notes on UFO sightings from 1933 to 1940.

00;04;07;21 - 00;04;25;07
Unknown
The document consisted of both telegrams and handwritten notes. The sender chose to remain anonymous, the penalty going only by Mr. X, but did claim to have inherited them from a family member who worked on Mussolini's supposed UFO program.

00;04;25;09 - 00;04;51;26
Unknown
Roberto received a series of three internal Italian government telegrams relating to the craft. Let's review each one in our first telegram, we see the telegram is sent by the Director of Special Affairs of the Stefani News Agency, the only agency of the Mussolini regime, as an official telegram of Milan. The priority of the telegram is labeled Lambo or highest, with a reserve Autismo a confidential rating.

00;04;51;28 - 00;05;17;28
Unknown
The telegram reads. Quote by order of the Duchy, the leader. Absolute silence as ordered of the presumed landing of an unknown aircraft on national soil. The version is to be published with today's dispatch as confirmed. The same version also applies to personnel and journalists. Maximum penalties for offenders up to and including appeal to the State Security Court. Please confirm receipt immediately.

00;05;18;00 - 00;05;46;23
Unknown
Our second telegram was set on the 13th of June, 1933 at 4 p.m., again from the Stefani News Agency, with Lamport priority and reserve a similar classification. This document reads quote by superior order, the news disclosed today and the Stefani Dispatch, number 63 310 should be treated as follows. The above mentioned aircraft has been recognized as a meteor by the Barrera Astronomical Observatory.

00;05;46;26 - 00;06;14;09
Unknown
Given the news the slightest graphic relevance, there is no need to rectify. Minimize. And finally, our third telegram was sent the same day, the 13th of June, 1933, with the same priority classification and sender, this time at 5:07 p.m. this telegram reads quote by order of the leader. It is ordered that circulation of the news about the craft of unknown nature referred to in today's Tiffany dispatch at 7:30 a.m., be stopped immediately.

00;06;14;11 - 00;06;40;03
Unknown
It is ordered that any leads for newspapers carrying this news be recast immediately. Maximum penalties for offenders up to and including appeal to the State Security Court. Please confirm receipt immediately. So with these three telegrams, we see the Italian press demand absolute silence over a landing of an unknown craft. Immediate arrest and maximum penalties were to be issued to any journalist commenting on the craft.

00;06;40;06 - 00;07;05;08
Unknown
From the telegrams, we can see the Italian propaganda initially pushed for journalists to treat the landing of the craft as an identified meteor, only to swiftly cease any and all reporting by Italian journalists. Does this not sound awfully similar to the Roswell incident? Quick media control to drown out the presence of a crashed UFO.

00;07;05;10 - 00;07;32;23
Unknown
If you look at the second and third telegrams I've shown you, you will notice an arms stamp in the telegram text field. Unfortunately, I can't find any sharp enough images to decipher what exactly the text on this field reads. However, remember in the description of the alleged magenta craft, a top secret scientific coalition was formed to investigate the craft, named the Gabi Netto Recherch√© Special Le 33 or the Rs 33.

00;07;32;25 - 00;07;57;10
Unknown
In other words, the special Group of 1933, well within the document, sent a penalty. We see an introduction directly mentioning the Rs 33 as a prelude to two sheets describing protocol for the crash. Atop the letter in two pages lies the stamp of the Kingdom Senate. This intro to this protocol memorandum has been translated by Paulo Gosar and reads, quote.

00;07;57;13 - 00;08;18;28
Unknown
Dear DeSantis, I am sending you as requested and agreed verbally, the note for your rule do not make copies. Do not even mention it to your deputy for any matter having to do with the Rs 33 office. Come to me first. I personally wrote these lines as to not expose them to the eyes of my secretaries, therefore adjust accordingly.

00;08;19;00 - 00;08;44;09
Unknown
So who is this DeSantis and who are the figures I mentioned earlier as connected with the Rs 33? DeSantis, the man to which the craft Recovery protocol was addressed, was almost assuredly a pseudonym for one Tomasso David, a colonel of the Frost, a known founder of the Volpi Argentine de spy group and later head of the Salo secret service, as discovered by Italian historian Arrigo Potato.

00;08;44;12 - 00;09;12;05
Unknown
Earlier I mentioned the possible connection of Guglielmo Marconi to the Rs 33, the Nobel Prize winning inventor of the Radio Marconi was an outspoken advocate for belief in extraterrestrials, pursuing the possibility of contacting them. A radio, as outlined in a rare article published in 1937 titled Guglielmo Marconi magician of the Invisible Ruler of Spaces by La Stella Mario, which itself referenced earlier claims by Marconi.

00;09;12;05 - 00;09;35;26
Unknown
In 1920 and 1932. At this time, in 1933, the strict propaganda machine of the Stephanie, as mentioned earlier, would cover everything under the regime bar the highest authorities. Benito Mussolini, Foreign Minister Ciano and Air Marshal Balbo. Due to this, it stands to reason the two men besides the Dutch would be read into the top secret Rs 33 channels.

00;09;35;26 - 00;10;00;02
Unknown
Likely involvement in Rs 33 and direct naming in the fascist UFO sightings post magenta will become apparent later in the video. It is worth mentioning the famous channel diaries that describe channels experience and involvement within Fascist Italy up to his execution in 1943, makes no mention of this secret group. However, it is understandable given the top secrecy of this commission.

00;10;00;04 - 00;10;33;21
Unknown
What is interesting, however, is a deep rabbit hole between Edda Channel channels wife and Mussolini's daughter. Alan Doles, The Ciano Diaries and Operation Sunrise as a front to retrieve the magenta UFO from the crumbling fascist state. This is not my research, so I will not pass it off as my own. However, if you guys are interested, I will see if I can do an interview with the really sharp Cat, who has spent countless hours digging into the craft retrieval process by the United States.

00;10;33;24 - 00;11;07;01
Unknown
Now onto the mentioned memorandum describing craft recovery to DeSantis in conjunction with the Rs 33. We see these labeled personal note very confidential. So let's go through all nine steps of protocol surrounding the magenta retrieval one. Notify the mayor to order the immediate recovery of the aircraft. Three order immediate arrest of all witnesses. Appoint special section Rs 33 of the overa to the Italian Gestapo present in each provincial capital.

00;11;07;04 - 00;11;37;24
Unknown
Four direct all reports with the utmost secrecy and precedence over all priority to the Central Meteorological Office at La Sapienza University in Rome. Exclusive relevance. Rs 33 office five to prevent ex officio the dissemination of any news, particularly in the press. Six for the purpose of the previous point, it is necessary to publish from time to time very short articles in which the phenomenon is reported to its authentic and unique celestial nature.

00;11;37;26 - 00;12;21;14
Unknown
Meteor shooting star. Planet. Luminous halo. Iris, etc. according to form Rs 30 3.4, previously transmitted to all the prefectures of the kingdom by special dispatch seven. Transmission of reports to the Air Force is subject to the prior favorable opinion of the Rs. 33 office, whose decisions are un appealable up to the highest hierarchy of the Duchy. Eight strict exclusion of any other scientific body from the collection and examination of the reports available, including the Pontifical University, and nine charge all expenses related to this provision to cap 32.

00;12;21;14 - 00;12;53;01
Unknown
Title IX II, heading 30 2-2 of the order to the R Accademia de Italia. Written authorization from Chief of Staff Rs 33. And a couple thoughts here, guys. Points eight and nine sound like protocol. Almost identical to use of regulation 202 from 1953, which I talk about all the time, in which UFO sightings were delegated strictly to the Air Force or higher authorities while restricting cases to be shared with scientific bodies and Project Bluebook.

00;12;53;03 - 00;13;24;15
Unknown
And all of this operating protocol sounds extremely similar to the alleged MMX 12 or majestic 12. If you don't know what that is, it is basically the alleged crash, retrieval and reverse engineering group that operates with complete autonomy to investigate Nye within the US. SG. This is a really rough summary, as maybe I need to cover the MJ 12 docs, but the Rs 33 sounds like an Italian precursor to the US body that would arise in the late 40s early 50s.

00;13;24;17 - 00;13;50;25
Unknown
So unlike the Stephanie telegrams and memorandums, I have no verifiable evidence here for craft storage. But according to the anonymous sender, Mr. X, the remains of the craft were stored in the shed of the Sia Marchetti Aeronautical Manufacturing Company. The trail here is incredibly confusing, as sometime during the 1943 year it is proposed the Nazis took control of the UFO and dissolved the Rs 33.

00;13;50;28 - 00;14;21;11
Unknown
A possible link here is a fire occurred in the CIA warehouse in his yacht on the 17th of March, 1943. The craft likely was then moved to Mussolini's enormous bunker under Mount Serrat, 27 miles north of Rome. At the time of its construction in 1937, the bunker was the largest in Europe, three miles long and 300ft underground. Rumor circulated the bunker was used to house military equipment, possibly a recovered energy craft.

00;14;21;13 - 00;14;41;21
Unknown
On the 8th of September 1943. The Germans executed Operation Oxi, disarming all Italian units and commandeering the bunker for the very act command for Southern Europe. More research needs to be done here to try to find a hard paper trail for the craft, but this is what we're working with for now.

00;14;41;24 - 00;15;09;08
Unknown
An additional piece to this already complex puzzle was included by Mr. X two penalty. These included a series of handwritten notes. Additionally bearing the seal of the Kingdom Senate, describing a UFO encounter titled mystery. With these is a 1936 Tiffany telegram about Westray, stating quote, absolute secrecy is required about unidentified aircraft mentioned in the 2347 confidential report. A letter will follow.

00;15;09;10 - 00;15;32;25
Unknown
Okay, and on to our letter. We see a curious drawing of a cigar shaped UFO with what appears to be an exhaust tail, not too dissimilar to a rocket engine, followed by two saucers with domes like ping pong balls on top. I'm immediately reminded of the flying saucer, as described by Lieutenant Jacobs and the 1948 Chili's witted encounter.

00;15;32;28 - 00;16;02;03
Unknown
In this UFO encounter, two American commercial pilots reported their aircraft nearly collided with a UFO over Montgomery, Alabama. The UFO, quote, looked like a wingless aircraft. It seemed to have two rows of windows through which glowed a very bright light, as brilliant as a magnesium flare. Comically, Guys Bluebook described this case as a meteor. Any who the text on this scribbled, handwritten note was thankfully transcribed by the Black Vault.

00;16;02;05 - 00;16;29;09
Unknown
This reads quote. It was observed in the morning. It was a metallic disk, polished and reflecting light, with a length of 10 or 12m. Two fighter aircraft from a nearby air force base took off, but were not able to reach it, even traveling at 130km/h. It did not admit any sound, which would lead one to consider an aerostat a balloon, but nobody knows of balloons that can fly faster than the wind.

00;16;29;11 - 00;17;01;12
Unknown
I know for sure that it was seen by other pilots. The report arrived in the hands of illegible. Then, after approximately an hour and a half of flying over yesterday, it was seen as a sort of metallic tube, gray or slate in color. A drawing by a confidential informant was redrawn by Andre, who, as far as the two A and B drawings are concerned, explained that A was described as being like a kind of aerial torpedo with very clear windows and with alternating white and red lights.

00;17;01;14 - 00;17;31;22
Unknown
B were two hats, two hats like those used by priests. They were wide round, with a dome in the center metallic, and followed the torpedo without changing their relative positions. The prefecture has opened an inquiry, but you can imagine that it will make little inroads and have a similar outcome to that of the 1931 case. The Dutch has expressed his worries because he says that if it were an English or French aircraft, his foreign policy would have to start all over again.

00;17;31;25 - 00;18;08;02
Unknown
And Italy wasn't just monitoring its own skies at this time. Here we can see from the archives of the prefecture in Milan, copies of telegrams from the prefects of the Kingdom of Italy to the government between 1933 and 1938, mentioning reports of, quote, unconventional flying vehicles and show the official attention of the Italian authorities to the problem. This telegram, signed by Prefect Martinelli, mentions the presence of unknown flying vehicles over the Luna in Albania, a country under Italian control.

00;18;08;05 - 00;18;32;09
Unknown
Of course, every single thing I talked about would be void if the documents were fake, right? Well, fortunately, Pannone took a skeptical approach when he was first contacted by Mr. X. He had the documents tested by a forensic expert, who said the paper and ink was from the period of the 1930s. Additionally, scientific consultant Antonio Garcia Vogler shared with Daily Mail, quote.

00;18;32;10 - 00;19;01;15
Unknown
It can be stated with reasonable certainty that this sample examined and the subject of the appraisal can be considered original and therefore authentic. Additionally, Italian Reddit user lo lab 5185 was able to lend his hand to the legitimacy of these documents by not only commenting on the writing style matching the Futurism era of fascist communication style, but also provided two examples of official telegram templates used by Italian authorities in the 1930s.

00;19;01;16 - 00;19;06;22
Unknown
See the resemblance here.

00;19;06;25 - 00;19;30;12
Unknown
Remember how in both the telegrams and the Rs 33 protocol, mention was made of labeling the craft's landing a meteor or other meteorological phenomena as directed by the agency's Stephanie. We'll check this out. We can actually find direct reporting of this disinformation from our telegram and testimony. We can conclude the crash or landing occurred on the 13th of June, 1933.

00;19;30;15 - 00;19;51;11
Unknown
From later that same month. We can find newspapers and magazines that report on inclement weather occurring in the magenta area, severe lightning storms and hail storms that illuminated the night sky, such as this paper from the 22nd of June, which reported the week prior a lightning strike that illuminated the night sky and struck five brick layers on the TriStar Magenta Road.

00;19;51;13 - 00;19;58;09
Unknown
Now on screen is a magazine illustration depicting the event.

00;19;58;12 - 00;20;28;23
Unknown
I unfortunately don't have much to go on for the magenta case connection to the Vatican and Pope Pius the 12th. We will have to go off the word of David Grush and reporting done by Christopher Sharp, predating Grush in his 2021 article. All UFO disclosure roads lead to Rome. Sharp writes about how initial relationships between Mussolini and the Catholic priesthood were quite good, and how the duchy confided with Pope Pius the 12th about the retrieved unknown craft.

00;20;28;25 - 00;20;51;26
Unknown
The Pope allegedly became uneasy about the craft being in Italian possession as Italy allied with the Nazis, thus leaking information to the U.S. about the craft. Due to the Pope's information, the facility which housed the craft was spared from Allied bombing. This curiously does in fact line up with the bunker charade we spoke about earlier. After the war or the end of 1944.

00;20;51;29 - 00;21;11;28
Unknown
The craft was brought to the U.S. of course, this is all based on reporting, and I do not have a paper trail. But Christopher Sharp is a well-respected journalist within the UAP realm. As we stand, we can prove the authenticity of the documents. But not yet. These anecdotal accounts.

00;21;12;00 - 00;21;45;24
Unknown
And lastly, my friends, as we opened with a powerful statement by David Grush, I would like to leave you with an additionally powerful statement by Lou Elizondo. And it gave a few hints before, but Roswell may not have been the first event. And well known. I mean, there's been some, some, some reporting internationally as well that there have been some, some crashed vehicles and they were, they were obtained by local authorities and, there was some, some scientific study done on them.

00;21;45;26 - 00;22;14;24
Unknown
I want to be very careful not to go too far down the rabbit hole, but I've seen personally some documentation that's very compelling from, from a particular foreign country, where they had a recovery of, of a vehicle and, they had some, some countries conducting scientific analysis on it. And, after World War II to, allegedly, parts of that that vehicle were brought to the United States.

00;22;14;27 - 00;22;47;23
Unknown
Yeah. I think I know both country that was enlisted in the South American country. I think, maybe Brazil, you know, had them I want to I Argentina, I'm not sure I well, I think it's Little Italy. Yeah, it was Italy. Yeah. That, as it was, explained to me, I saw some documentation. Look, you know, I, I don't want to get too much into the, you know, conspiracy side of the house.

00;22;47;25 - 00;23;12;10
Unknown
There is some documentation that has been validated. That was, that was from Mussolini himself. And, it's, it's, you know, it's it's authentic. It's been proven to be authentic. The documentation, so certainly interesting. Hey, guys, thank you so much for joining me today as we took this dive into the 1933 magenta, Italy case.

00;23;12;12 - 00;23;30;09
Unknown
Sorry for a little bit of time away. Had some family in town for their spring break, but now that that's done, we're back in action. Personally, I find this case scintillating. It's the Roswell before Roswell. There's a rich paper trail here, as shown by Pinot. So this is the kind of case I love, where we have documents we can dive into.

00;23;30;14 - 00;23;52;27
Unknown
We can cross-reference. We can see what's going on with legitimate documentation. So I remember when Grush first went public with his News Nation interview and he referenced this case. I was gobsmacked, shocked as Ross cold heart would like to say. And immediately I dove into learning more and as much as I could about the magenta case. I find this case particularly compelling.

00;23;53;00 - 00;24;23;02
Unknown
Especially the idea that Benito Mussolini, who wasn't the sharpest tool in the shed, thought this was a craft of of British or German or French origin. And I find the, description of de Klerk particularly interesting, this kind of bell shaped saucer type UFO. I know there were some details added later on by one, I think William Brophy or William Brophy, his grandson, who claimed that there were bodies uncovered, as we can see in the original documentation, we find no evidence of bodies.

00;24;23;02 - 00;24;46;21
Unknown
So of course, I don't want to include those when I don't have any sort of hard evidence. Not sure about his claims. I think this man was involved in some other hoaxes, but, I purposefully did not include that in today's video. And if you guys are interested, I will talk to the gentleman who has done countless hours of work into finding the connection process as to how the U.S. retrieved the craft.

00;24;46;23 - 00;25;04;23
Unknown
I did not cover this because I could not talk about this without basically copying his work. That would undermine my credibility and undermine the dozens, if not hundreds of hours he has put into pouring through documents. So that's just not how I roll. I respect the man completely, but I would love to cover that if I can get him on the show.

00;25;04;25 - 00;25;21;03
Unknown
As always guys, please remember to like and subscribe. This has been a particularly active week in UFOs with the Aero Report and the Dean Johnson FOIA request, so we have a lot to cover coming up guys. Hope you enjoyed this video and I will catch everybody next time. Thank you.
