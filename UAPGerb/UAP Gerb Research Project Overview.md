## 📌 UAP Gerb Project Overview (Instructions for AI & Researcher)

### 🔍 Purpose:
This document serves as a **guideline for collaboration** between the researcher (you) and the AI (me). It outlines how we manage, expand, and refine the UAP research database using Obsidian and external documentation.

### 📂 Project Workflow:
1. **Identify Missing Sections** - Check the directory listing for missing categories (e.g., Whistleblowers, Government Secrecy, Military Encounters).
2. **Expand Existing Entries** - Fill in summaries, add references, and cross-link related topics.
3. **Organize Research** - Ensure Markdown files are formatted, tagged, and categorized properly.
4. **Generate Reports** - Use the Python script to compile the latest research into a Word document and directory listing.
5. **Review & Update** - Ensure new research is reflected in both **Obsidian** and the exported documents.

### 🏗 AI Instructions:
- **When asked about missing files**, check the directory listing and suggest priority additions.
- **When expanding case summaries**, integrate structured details like:
  - Timeline of events
  - Key witnesses and figures
  - Evidence and claims
  - Related documents & investigations
  - Cross-references to existing research
  - Open questions for further study
- **When reviewing existing research**, ensure logical connections and proper formatting.
- **Maintain a running log** of updates made in each session to track progress.

### 🏛 Project Structure:
- **Incidents** (`01_Incidents/`) - Historical UFO cases (e.g., Roswell, Malmstrom AFB, USS Trepang USO).
- **Whistleblowers** (`02_Whistleblowers/`) - Testimonies from individuals like David Grusch and Bob Lazar.
- **Government Secrecy** (`03_Government_Secrecy/`) - Programs, leaked documents, and classified initiatives.
- **Military Encounters** (`04_Military_Encounters/`) - Global military reports of UAP.

### 🔄 Next Steps:
- **Populate the missing Whistleblower, Government Secrecy, and Military Encounters sections.**
- **Expand existing case summaries with more structured evidence and references.**
- **Ensure new findings are reflected in both the Word document and Obsidian vault.**
