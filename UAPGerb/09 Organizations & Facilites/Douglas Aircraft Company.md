### **Introduction**

The **Douglas Aircraft Company** was a **major American aerospace manufacturer** from **1921–1967** before merging with **McDonnell Aircraft** to form **McDonnell Douglas**. Historically, it played a **critical role in advanced military aircraft, secret projects, and potential UFO-related research**.

There are claims that Douglas **worked on classified programs involving UAP reverse engineering**, possibly in collaboration with **Wright-Patterson AFB**, **Lockheed Skunkworks**, and **Area 51/S4**.
