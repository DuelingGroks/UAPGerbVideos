# Battelle Memorial Institute

## 📌 Overview
**Battelle Memorial Institute** is a private, nonprofit **applied science and technology development** company that has historically engaged in **classified contracts** with the U.S. government. Renowned for its work on the **Manhattan Project** (uranium processing), the **Apollo 11** program (combustion, energy, and propellants), and **biological/chemical defense**, Battelle also manages or co-manages several **DOE laboratories** (e.g., Los Alamos, Oak Ridge, National Renewable Energy Lab).

Despite promoting itself as a force for scientific advancement, **multiple sources** and whistleblowers have alleged Battelle’s **deep involvement in UFO research** and potential **crash-retrieval reverse-engineering**. This includes:

- **Project Stork** (1950s): Analyzing and categorizing UFO reports on behalf of the Air Force.  
- **Shape-memory alloy (Nitinol) research** that may connect to **Roswell crash debris**.  
- Ongoing alleged ties to **UAP secrecy** via high-level figures (e.g., **Ronald Moultrie**) who have served on Battelle’s board.

## 🕰 Historical Highlights

- **Founded**: 1923 (by industrialist Gordon Battelle’s philanthropic trust).  
- **Manhattan Project Era**: Provided metallurgy expertise for uranium and nuclear programs.  
- **Cold War Research**: Engaged in chemical, biological, and advanced materials R&D for the U.S. military.  
- **Modern-Day Labs**: Manages or co-manages multiple Department of Energy facilities, often performing cutting-edge research in **energy, nanotech, and security**.

## 🔎 UFO / UAP Connections

1. **Project Stork (Early 1950s)**  
   - Collaborated with the USAF (ATIC) to develop a “**machine indexing system**” for UFO sightings.  
   - Allegedly wrote internal memos about “**reassuring the public**” regarding UFO concerns.

2. **Special Report No. 14**  
   - Battelle contributed data analysis to the Air Force’s Blue Book files.  
   - Officially concluded “no physical matter recovered from UFOs,” yet contradictory internal research on advanced metals suggests otherwise.

3. **Shape-Memory Alloys / Nitinol**  
   - In 1949–1950, Battelle performed R&D on **nickel-titanium alloys** (akin to Nitinol), a decade before the metal’s “official” discovery.  
   - UFO researchers speculate that **Roswell debris** (notably “memory metal”) was sent to Battelle for analysis under **Wright-Patterson AFB** contract.

4. **EJ Center Testimony**  
   - A Battelle researcher who allegedly told family/friends he worked on “**parts retrieved from a flying saucer**” in the late 1940s or early 1950s.  
   - Corroborates the timeline of hush-hush materials research at Battelle.

5. **Modern Ties & Alleged Secrecy**  
   - **Ronald Moultrie**, Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence (overseeing AARO), served on Battelle’s board. Critics argue this fosters conflicts of interest in official UAP transparency.  
   - David Grusch, Jacques Vallee, and other whistleblowers point to **private contractors** like Battelle as key players in “**legacy crash retrieval**” efforts.

## 🛠 Notable Projects & Facilities

- **National Labs**: Co-manages Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, National Renewable Energy Lab, etc.  
- **Advanced Metallurgy Divisions**: Historically known for breakthroughs in special alloys (e.g., titanium, nickel, nuclear metals).  
- **Classified SAP Work**: Battelle’s official statements remain minimal, but records of “**restricted**” or “**no FOIA**” labeling hint at deep black programs.

## ❓ Open Questions

- **Ongoing Influence**: Does Battelle still have a role in storing or studying potential UAP materials?  
- **Private Classification**: How do “restricted” or internal corporate classification systems impede government oversight (e.g., FOIA)?  
- **Whistleblower Evidence**: Will more insiders, like EJ Center, come forward confirming clandestine UFO research at Battelle?
