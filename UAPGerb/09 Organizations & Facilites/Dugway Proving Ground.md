### **Introduction**

**Dugway Proving Ground (DPG)** is a **highly classified U.S. Army testing facility** located in **Utah**. Established in **1942**, it is primarily known for **biological and chemical weapons testing**, but it has also been **linked to UAP research, exotic propulsion experiments, and secret aerospace programs**. Due to its **remote location, extensive underground facilities, and restricted airspace**, some researchers refer to Dugway as **"the new Area 51."**
