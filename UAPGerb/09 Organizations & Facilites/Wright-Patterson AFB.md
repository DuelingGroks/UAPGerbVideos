### **Introduction**

**Wright-Patterson AFB (WPAFB)**, located in **Dayton, Ohio**, has long been considered one of the most significant locations in **U.S. military UFO history**. It has been linked to **UFO crash retrieval programs, secret aerospace research, and advanced propulsion studies**.

Historically, WPAFB was home to **Project Blue Book**, the **Foreign Technology Division (FTD)**, and alleged storage facilities for **retrieved UAP materials** in **Hangar 18**. Some researchers believe **Wright-Patterson played a key role in studying recovered non-human craft and biological entities**.

## **üöÄ WPAFB & UAP Research**

### **1. Hangar 18 & UFO Crash Retrievals**

- **Alleged storage site** for **wreckage from the 1947 Roswell crash** and **other UAP retrievals**.
- Claims that **non-human biologics** from crash sites were analyzed at **WPAFB laboratories**.
- **Whistleblower testimonies** suggest deep compartmentalization of **crash retrieval and reverse engineering programs**.

### **2. Foreign Technology Division (FTD) & Reverse Engineering**

- The **FTD (now NASIC - National Air and Space Intelligence Center)** was responsible for analyzing **advanced foreign aerospace technology**, including **UAP materials**.
- Connections to **Lockheed Skunk Works**, **Battelle Memorial Institute**, and **Los Alamos National Laboratory** for **studying exotic materials**.
- Speculation that **reverse engineering efforts** from retrieved UAPs were **funneled into black budget aerospace projects**.

### **3. Project Blue Book & Government Secrecy**

- WPAFB was the headquarters for **Project Blue Book (1952‚Äì1969)**, the U.S. Air Force‚Äôs **official UFO investigation program**.
- While Project Blue Book **publicly downplayed UFO reports**, some insiders suggest **classified cases were studied separately**.
- Links to **MJ-12 and other secret programs** suggest WPAFB was a hub for **UFO-related intelligence gathering**.
