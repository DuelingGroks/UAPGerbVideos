# **üìå Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL)**

### **Introduction**

**Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL)** is a **U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) research facility** founded in **1952** in **Livermore, California**. It specializes in **nuclear weapons research, materials science, and advanced propulsion technologies**.

Due to its **deep involvement in classified defense research**, LLNL has been **linked to UAP reverse engineering**, **exotic materials analysis**, and **potential secret aerospace programs**. Some researchers believe LLNL plays a key role in **analyzing recovered UAP debris**, particularly in **connection with Battelle Memorial Institute and Wright-Patterson AFB**.
