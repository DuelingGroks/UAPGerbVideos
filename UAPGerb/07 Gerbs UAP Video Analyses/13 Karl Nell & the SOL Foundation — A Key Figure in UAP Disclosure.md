**Video Published:** February 14, 2024  
**Video Link:** [YouTube – Karl Nell SOL Foundation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKbSIfc7N7Q)  
**Approx. Length:** ~21–22 minutes

## 📌 Overview

This video focuses on **Colonel Karl Nell**—a retired U.S. Army Intelligence officer with firsthand experience on the **UAP Task Force**—and his recent **SOL Foundation** talk on controlled disclosure, the Schumer Amendment, and the road to a “post-disclosure” world. Nell’s statements clarify how UAP legislation has evolved, why the term **“non-human intelligence (NHI)”** appears in recent lawmaking, and what a “**controlled**” vs. “**catastrophic**” disclosure scenario might entail.

Nell also covers:

- **Schumer Amendment** and its attempt to unify UAP data across government and private sectors.  
- **Eminent domain clauses** for retrieving crash debris and materials.  
- The differences between **UAP** (truly unknown) and **TNO** (temporarily non-attributed but eventually explained).  
- **Reasons for secrecy** vs. **reasons for open disclosure** (national security, arms race, social disruption, technology exploitation, etc.).  
- A “**Way Forward** UAP Campaign Plan,” mapping out phased milestones from shaping public narrative to potential academic integration and, ultimately, large-scale acceptance.  

Nell’s **omitted slides**—leaked after the event—include a rethinking of the **Kardashev Scale** and a deep taxonomy of potential UAP / NHI origins (physical, psycho-physical, metaphysical, or parallel realities). These slides reflect how the SOL Foundation envisions shaping broader scientific discourse on UAP and NHI.

Finally, **Leslie Kean** has noted Nell was likely among the 40+ firsthand witnesses interviewed by David Grusch. Nell himself is mentioned in the infamous Debrief article supporting Grusch’s claim of an international “arms race” to exploit non-human craft.

## 📝 Key Takeaways

1. **Schumer Amendment & Controlled Disclosure**  
   - Legislation is pushing for systematic gathering of UAP data.  
   - Shift away from stigmatized terms (e.g., UFO → UAP, ET → NHI).  
   - Government wants to avoid a sudden “catastrophic” information dump.

2. **Eminent Domain & Legacy Programs**  
   - The Amendment contemplates taking ownership of exotic debris and materials from private contractors.  
   - Mentions “Legacy” or “Crash Retrieval” programs that might be hidden outside normal government oversight.

3. **Multi-Phase “Way Forward” Campaign**  
   - Outlines a stepwise approach (Phase 0–5) to remove stigma, gather data, foster acceptance, and eventually reach open integration.

4. **Omitted Slides – New Taxonomies**  
   - Suggest multiple categories for NHI (physical vs. metaphysical), acknowledging advanced civilizations might have varying motives/tech.

5. **Colonel Nell as Potential Whistleblower**  
   - Nell was a key UAP Task Force participant and singled out in the original Debrief article.  
   - His background in foreign material exploitation could indicate direct involvement with exotic retrievals.

On June 5th, 2023. The now legendary Debrief article titled intelligence Officials Say U.S. has Retrieved Craft of Non-human Origin by Leslie Keane and Ralph Blumenthal took the world by storm. This article introduced the world to David Grush and solidified the fact the USG is in possession of craft of non-human origin and actively attempts crash retrieval and reverse engineering of these anomalous vehicles.

00;00;25;21 - 00;01;01;19
Unknown
Within this article, one Karl Nellis mentioned a now retired Army colonel who worked with Grush on the UAP Task force. While Nell has one quote in this article supporting the assertions of David Grush. He states an astounding fact quote his assertion concerning the existence of a terrestrial arms race occurring sub Rosa over the past 80 years focused on reverse engineering technologies of unknown origin, is fundamentally correct, as is the indisputable realization that at least some of these technologies of unknown origin derive from non-human intelligence.

00;01;01;22 - 00;01;26;15
Unknown
Hey guys, it's UAP Gerb! And today I wanted to do a quick video talking about coral melt and his crucial role in UAP disclosure, the importance of Nell's data and position on UAP, as detailed in this recent Soar Foundation symposium talk, simply cannot be understated. Guys, you know me. This is not just a reaction. Video of Nell's 31 minute talk at the Soar Foundation.

00;01;26;17 - 00;01;45;22
Unknown
I've already picked out all the important parts I want to discuss, made the proper connections, and so let's go through it. I'm not here to waste your time. Let's start before we break down Colonel Nell's speech on the Soar Foundation, on the Schumer amendment and the push for control disclosure. Let's quickly cover what exactly the sole foundation is.

00;01;45;24 - 00;02;15;15
Unknown
The sole foundation is a group of scientists and academia, folk military personnel and government or policy makers that seek to educate the public on academic legitimacy of UAP and push for a post disclosure world. The Soar Foundation includes figures whose credibility is beyond reproach, such as former DEP set, Christopher Mellon whistleblower David Grush, Stanford pathology professor Gary Nolan, PhD, physicist Kevin Knuth, Colonel Nel, and more.

00;02;15;17 - 00;02;35;21
Unknown
Nel spoke to the symposium in November 2023 at the Nolan Laboratory of the Stanford School of Medicine. So let's break down and cover his key points. If you have your finger on the pulse, you'll remember the speech happening and some apparent leaked slides from his presentation. But it's not till February 2024. We've actually got to see the whole presentation.

00;02;35;23 - 00;03;10;22
Unknown
Nell begins by breaking down the groundbreaking Schumer amendment. Well, ten years ago, probably the Schumer amendment would have been viewed as, UAP UFO disclosure. I've talked about this piece of legislation at length and almost every single one of my videos, but thankfully now provides a comprehensive summary of this legislation. He goes on to discuss background to the UAP Disclosure Act, citing the importance of Leslie Kean's article that appeared on the 16th of December 2017, bringing Fleer Gimbal and go fast to the public domain as a major paradigm shift now.

00;03;10;22 - 00;03;36;22
Unknown
Thanks, Chris Mellon and Lou Elizondo for this tireless work to get these videos released and move the ball forward on UAP. So certainly that was a key incident. The next piece, was, I would argue, the David Grush, Ryan Graves, David Fravor, testimony before Congress again lowering the threshold of making this topic respectable and, and incentivizing some discussion about it.

00;03;36;24 - 00;03;53;27
Unknown
Two of the legislators that sponsored this bill are in the Gang of Eight. The Gang of Eight includes the leaders of each of the two parties from the Senate and House of Representatives, and the chairs of the ranking minority members of both the Senate Committee and the House Committee for intelligence, as set forth by the 50 U.S.C. purpose.

00;03;53;29 - 00;04;17;03
Unknown
Certain members of Congress are legally entitled to hear about all information pertaining to SAPs and secret programs. Now goes on to state the importance of the two members here who are privy to all read and access, yet have not been informed on UAP. Colonel nel then goes on to talk about the scope of the legislation and how changing reference terminology can start to strip away the stigma.

00;04;17;05 - 00;04;44;20
Unknown
You know, shift UFO to UAP, USO to USB, flying saucer to UAP, and ETS to Nye. I think this is a beautiful reference by the Colonel as terms like UFO, flying saucer, extraterrestrials even are deeply ingrained in this stigma and are often scoffed at when mentioned. But UAP Nye are now termed an official legislation and must be taken seriously.

00;04;44;27 - 00;05;13;09
Unknown
Take a look here at the Now six characteristics of UAP referenced. I often reference the five as listed by Lou Elizondo, but note item six physical or invasive biological effects. This is a fascinating addition, likely brought to the table by Gary Nolan, who is studying this aspect of the phenomenon. Think about the fear wagon felt when he saw the UFO craft or something like Havana Syndrome.

00;05;13;12 - 00;06;00;20
Unknown
The Schumer amendment focuses specifically on UAP, not T and O, as this graphic beautifully highlights unknown unknowns. But let me read here what the actual legislation says. So we know specifically what they intended was Schumer. UAP is any object operating or judge capable of operating in outer space, the atmosphere, ocean, surface or undersea, lacking prosaic attribution due to performance characteristics and properties not previously known to be achievable based upon commonly understood principles of physics, there's a massive difference between UAP and TNO, and there's a huge distinction between these, and Schumer makes this explicit.

00;06;00;22 - 00;06;26;05
Unknown
So TNO is a class of objects that temporarily resist prosaic attribution by the initial observer due to performance, or due to environmental or system limitations associated with the observation process, but that nevertheless have a known accepted human origin. So TNO is the stuff that you mistake at the time of observation, but you later figure out like what it is.

00;06;26;07 - 00;06;52;01
Unknown
So if you look at Bluebook, you know, depending on the statistics, you want to use the, the 94% or the 80% of what they spent their time on was TNO is all explainable. There is the residual to continue touching on the legislation here. No references a slide on the NDAA executive Summary. The key takeaway here is utilizing the National Archives to archive all UAP data now states what we are all thinking.

00;06;52;03 - 00;07;23;13
Unknown
Nobody necessarily trusts that that's going to happen. And I think therefore the review board will provide oversight unlike the 1992 JFK records oversight here now references the issue of materials, biological evidence of Nye, and technology of unknown origins. Thus, the Schumer amendment allows for eminent domain of these materials. Colonel nel explains the terms Nye legacy programs, prosaic attribution and t u o that appear specifically in the Schumer amendment.

00;07;23;15 - 00;07;48;13
Unknown
He makes it apparent that the NDAA was searching specifically for anything that is non-human related. These are terms of reference in the legislation, so non-human intelligence at least 18 times cited in there any sentient, intelligent, non-human life form, regardless of nature or ultimate origin, that may be presume responsible for UAP less than the earlier definition, or of which the federal government has become aware.

00;07;48;16 - 00;08;16;17
Unknown
Legacy program. All federal, state, local government, commercial, industry, academic, private sector endeavors to collect, exploit, reverse engineer to our biological evidence. Then he first contribution attribution. You remember this was in both of those terms UAP and you know prosaic attribution having a human either foreign or domestic origin. So UAPs non-human tno human technology of unknown origin, this is very important for the eminent domain clause.

00;08;16;19 - 00;08;53;17
Unknown
Any material or random material object to crash debris mechanisms, machinery, equipment, assemblies of subassemblies. Engineering models of processes, damaged or intact aerospace vehicles or damaged or intact ocean surface or undersea craft associated with UAP, or incorporating science and technology lacking prosaic attribution or known means of human manufacture. The Colonel then goes on to highlight arguments for and against eminent domain of all UAP record and materials, and for those of you who don't know, eminent domain is essentially the federal government's ability to take whatever they want, whenever they want.

00;08;53;20 - 00;09;20;05
Unknown
What is interesting here is that some of the cons infringe on property ownership here. L.A. specifically referring to private corporations in possession of UAP and UAP material, now moves on to make the key distinction between control disclosure and catastrophic disclosure. This difference being controlled disclosure uses a campaign to plan, and catastrophic disclosure is essentially the opening of the floodgates.

00;09;20;07 - 00;09;53;09
Unknown
All information dumped out there by possibly an adversary or Nai themselves to create social disruption or other means. Unfortunately, the Schumer Rounds amendment was watered down and gutted by adversaries. To pro disclosure, hopefully this bill in its entirety will be released in the near future. Maybe the 2025 NDAA here now states reasons for and against non-disclosure. This is an extremely intriguing slide, and logically, all six reasons make sense.

00;09;53;12 - 00;10;26;28
Unknown
National security implications, lack of a credible plan, social disruption, covert agreements cover for misdeeds and organizational intransigence slash distraction from priorities. We know from crush, an almost cold war has been conducted to keep knowledge of UAP from adversaries, specifically China and Russia. Addressing the national security risks posted here. I am really interested in the new physics slash technologies that have unprecedented ramifications for all human society.

00;10;27;01 - 00;10;52;20
Unknown
And look at the covert agreement, section nine, quid pro quo. Is it possible and true that the USG has made deals or agreements with Nye, as some people have suggested, and the cover for misdeeds? This is also addressed by gross. Part of the reason for the cover up is in fact feudal Istic dominance and numerous crimes, including murder, have been conducted to keep these secrets.

00;10;52;23 - 00;11;24;02
Unknown
But now take a look at the cons or essentially pro disclosure agreements under prevent loss of technological dominance here. Look at some evidence suggests the US may be losing a UAP arms race. If this is true, and Russia or China are near breakthroughs of harnessing an AI, this has global power shift levels of implications. As Nell states, all of these issues are better solved in an academic sector and are largely not government issues.

00;11;24;02 - 00;12;02;20
Unknown
Besides the Cold War, an arms race. And now we arrive to Nell's famous slide, which partially leaked back in November 2023. Titled Way Forward UAP Campaign Plan lines of Effort, this slide is absurdly perplexing, so let's break it down to reach a post disclosure world with proper oversight restored, catastrophic disclosure avoided, and scientific understanding advanced, Nell envisions a campaign with five major phases through four major channels the public sector, philosophical investigation, scientific research, and the private sector.

00;12;02;23 - 00;12;27;08
Unknown
Phase zero consists of shaping the narrative around UAP, which was done successfully by eight top DoD videos. The 2017 New York Times article and UAP Task Force notice. Guys, how Aero is not listed here. I'm sure Sean Kirkpatrick is seething. Phase one, which has a targeted end date of January 1st, 2024. It seems all but complete, ending with the Schumer legislation.

00;12;27;11 - 00;13;00;12
Unknown
Government acceptance has been achieved. UAP is now largely a bipartisan issue and reactive hypothesis generation is popping up, such as the newly published paper claiming that some UAP are plasma based. Pre life phase two aims to correlate signatures by January 1st, 2026, garnering a more stringent approach and harnessing of academia like the Sol Foundation is doing, likely due to the stigma persisting around serious academic research, this phase is still at risk.

00;13;00;15 - 00;13;24;23
Unknown
Phase three plans to be completed by October 1st, 2030 and is seen as an inflection point by now, possibly serving as the disclosure point for humanity. This phase seeks public acceptance, which is a tall ask if you ask me. Phase four to be completed by the 1st of October 2034, aims to fully answer the five W's who, what, when, where and why.

00;13;24;25 - 00;13;49;18
Unknown
This phase is off target. And finally, phase five has an indefinite timeline. Looking for an interactive approach with UAP in a strategic end state, possibly meaning integrating high and no high technology with our Earth and civilization. Now has a couple ideas for each of the four channels and how they can lead to a post disclosure world. So these this is the government line of past humor.

00;13;49;21 - 00;14;12;19
Unknown
Grant legal amnesty, centralize the data. Create a Manhattan Project to address this area. Sponsor National Science Foundation, grants charter in an IEEE National Intel Estimate to assess the public private positions of every country with this topic and where they are with it, and use that to tee up a united nation Summit or World Congress on developing, new norms of behavior.

00;14;12;19 - 00;14;34;17
Unknown
In this context, I think we need a sociological model for analyzing the societal impact for disclosure and then developing mitigation strategies a priori to address that. Now, some people think that may be less of a concern or more of a concern. This is kind of irrelevant. Like it's an unknown right now. We need a plan to address it to lower that that that concern, codify the laws of ethics.

00;14;34;20 - 00;15;00;10
Unknown
In an environment where we might have a hierarchy of being, where everyone isn't necessarily having equal competitive potential, how do you is essentially translating our special relativity version of ethics to a general, tidy version of ethics where you've got, the problem of a more advanced civilization coming in and, disrupting a less advanced civilization, developing theoretical as well as practical methods to analyze metamaterials.

00;15;00;18 - 00;15;32;15
Unknown
And let's get to the point where we can actually talk about utilizing the what is it, 339 isotopes and Engineering materials out of that, instead of the, 118 elements that were in sort of limited to we need it were game the business utility of forming consortiums to actually, look at this material. If the government was actually going to make it available, codified precedents and legal standards for determining, intellectual property rights over the material, analyzing, economic incentives and, the impact to the economy if new energy sources were developed.

00;15;32;17 - 00;16;07;19
Unknown
Nell's presentation is poignant and powerful, with astounding implications. But we can go a little deeper here. Now let's visit to back up slides not showed on Nell's presentation, as provided by Matthew Pines. The first of these slides looks to replace the Kardashev scale. I talked about this in part two of my iceberg, but essentially the Kardashev scale benchmarks, the technological capabilities of a civilization and places them into three types a planetary civilization that is able to harness all the energy from their home planet.

00;16;07;22 - 00;16;36;21
Unknown
A stellar civilization which is able to harness all of the energy from its host star, and a galactic civilization which is able to harness the complete energy output of its home galaxy. We are currently an estimated 0.72 on the Kardashev scale. Look at this line, since it is not implausible given the diversity of UAP sightings, that numerous civilizations may be interacting concurrently.

00;16;36;23 - 00;17;04;15
Unknown
That is just such an intriguing thought, but this new scale looks to develop a universal civilization development datum to try and forecast energy motives based on attributes instead of just a sliding scale. This is a new multivariable system in which what they are, what they know, and who they are are gauged and plotted. The end states for these civilizations are quite astounding.

00;17;04;18 - 00;17;36;05
Unknown
Spacetime manipulation, understanding reality and immortality slash physical transcendence are the three kind of variable reference points of these civilizations. I am honestly blown away by this slide. The proposed taxonomy of UAP and origin hypothesis in struggle to know where to even start. UAP hypothesis and Nye are broken up here into three main categories physical, psychophysical, and metaphysical.

00;17;36;07 - 00;18;12;20
Unknown
Within the physical are origins that span from expected to downright bizarre. We have, of course, are natural phenomena humans, intergalactic ETS, and even proto humans. But then we also have stranded gods, unknown regions of space time, disconnected hyperspace, 3D avatars or holograms. As Grush once mentioned, with the holographic universe within physical, we even get weirder with colliding universes, parallel universes, macro quantum fluctuations, pan galactic entanglement, and distance recursion.

00;18;12;22 - 00;18;36;07
Unknown
And now we get the medical physical in which supernatural forces incorporeal life forms, ascended masters, angelic or demonic beans, artificial realities, and more are mentioned. This is wild stuff and actually thinking of some fun. Please let me know if you would like me to do a tier list on these proposed taxonomies. Just my personal opinion on all these topics.

00;18;36;07 - 00;18;58;10
Unknown
But of course that could be an absolute blast because I'll tell you right now, I identify more with the physical range of explanations and not just the, you know, pretty standard stuff, but I'd like to get into that. Things with now couldn't get any weirder, right? But what if I told you he was one of the 40 firsthand witness whistleblowers that Grush interviewed?

00;18;58;12 - 00;19;23;23
Unknown
Check out this Leslie Cain clip that we're going to see is that other whistleblowers, some of whom have already given testimony to Congress, they might decide to go public and others may come to Congress now that they've seen what happened. At the hearing yesterday, David Grush said in his testimony that he talked to 40 people over four years, all of whom had information on a secret military program that has non-human craft and remains.

00;19;23;25 - 00;19;45;09
Unknown
Is it surprising to you that none of those 40 people has spoken out? It is. It actually, isn't it? Is it? I mean, some of them have. One of them actually was in our article in The Debrief, a man, a former Army colonel named Carl Mitchell. I think maybe some of them have spoken out a little bit and we just don't maybe put it all together.

00;19;45;09 - 00;20;05;10
Unknown
But it really isn't surprising because of the repercussions that people face. And they Grush is an example of that. He talked a little bit of in the hearing yesterday about the repercussions that he's faced, which are very harmful to him, both personally and professionally. Professionally for speaking out, though I think others have the same concerns and they've seen it happen to him.

00;20;05;10 - 00;20;27;01
Unknown
They want to wait and make sure it's safe for them to come forward and not have to face the same kinds of things that David Graff faced. Yeah. Can you elaborate on that? And he just said he had I'd like to thank Twitter ace UAP News at High Peak 77 for making a thread on this. In Colonel Neil's LinkedIn bio, he served as the technical intelligence operations officer for the Dia here states.

00;20;27;01 - 00;21;08;14
Unknown
Quote, first person deployed from the CIA directorate of Intelligence, Production and Analysis to participate in multi-agency planning for Operation Iraqi Freedom as the Foreign Materials Program Command representative to U.S. sent com slash cf LCC in Kuwait. Served as the c slash J2 for the one star combined joint. Captured Materiel Exploitation Center in Iraq. And as we know from Shellenberger article, dozens of government whistleblowers have given testimony to Congress, Pentagon, and Inspector general says sources that there have been ongoing crash retrieval programs of both foreign vehicles and UAP.

00;21;08;17 - 00;21;35;28
Unknown
Could Nels role in this Iraq mission seen him encounter a downed UAP, leading to his firsthand witness testimony? I got a lot more to dive into here, so stay tuned. But thank you again, UAP news for that Twitter thread. Hey guys, I know this video turned out almost as long as Colonel Nell's talk itself, but still I thought it important to try and break down everything that he said in this, solo symposium.

00;21;36;00 - 00;21;56;15
Unknown
I hope you guys enjoyed this breakdown. There's a lot of other interesting talks from the Sol Foundation event I want to go through, including crushes, Chris Malins, Kevin Knuth, Gary Nolan, Jack belay as well. So if you guys like this, stay tuned for that. I had a lot of fun making this. I hope you don't mind the not kind of reaction style.

00;21;56;15 - 00;22;14;05
Unknown
I wanted to watch this and make sure I had all my thoughts first before I reported information. Everybody not do kind of a, not much effort watch through together. So I hope you enjoyed it. Just a quick video today. Please remember to like and subscribe and I will catch you guys on the next video. Thank you.
