### üìå Overview

In **‚ÄúIncredible UFO Footage ‚Äì FLYBY,‚Äù** UAP Gerb analyzes a mysterious clip dating back to **2008** that shows what appears to be a **saucer-shaped UFO** flying extremely close to the **wing of an F/A-18 Super Hornet** (or similar military jet). The video is notoriously **low-resolution** yet exhibits flight characteristics (e.g., no visible propulsion, abrupt acceleration) that align with Lue Elizondo‚Äôs recognized UAP traits.

Gerb delves into:

1. **Possible Authenticity**: Is this a ‚Äúreal deal‚Äù cockpit capture, or is it CGI?
2. **Audio Analysis**: Ambiguous cockpit sounds and voice murmurs in the background.
3. **Craft Shape & Historical Similarities**: Comparisons with classic **saucer** sightings and older photographs.
4. **Alleged Classified Document**: A rumored ‚ÄúUAP Task Force‚Äù comms log referencing a fighter intercept scenario eerily matching this footage.

### üîç Key Discussion Points

8. **Authenticity Debate**
    
    - The clip shows a classic disc shape with minimal pixel clarity. Could be a real cockpit leak or a skillful CGI/hoax.
    - Reflection elements in the footage suggest it‚Äôs filmed from **inside a cockpit** or from a carefully staged environment.
9. **Audio Forensics**
    
    - **Ambiguous chatter** in the background. A Reddit user tried isolating voices, finding a possible **female** voice.
    - Potential mismatch between what we see on screen and the audio track‚Äîcould be layered from another source.
10. **Comparable UFO Encounters**
    
    - Lue Elizondo and Christopher Mellon have publicly stated some classified videos show UFOs within **50 ft of cockpits**.
    - The UFO in question resembles classic sightings: **McMinnville photos**, **Bob Lazar‚Äôs ‚Äúsport model,‚Äù** etc.
11. **Leaked UAPTF Report**
    
    - Purported ‚ÄúAppendix F, Section 4B‚Äù logs mention a close-range intercept, consistent with the imagery in the video.
    - The same document references 1,292 UFO cases, possible **autonomous or mechanical life forms,** and ‚Äúbehavioral data analysis.‚Äù
12. **Rabbit Holes & Speculation**
    
    - If the leak is genuine, it suggests a **high-value** or ‚Äúlegacy‚Äù UFO video studied within the UAP Task Force.
    - Alternatively, it may be an elaborate hoax, given the complexity and detailed pilot jargon.

### ‚ùì Open Questions

17. **Is there any verifiable chain of custody for the original high-res file?**
18. **Does the alleged comms log truly match the visual cues from the footage?**
19. **Could official channels (FOIA requests) confirm or deny the authenticity of this rumored ‚ÄúAppendix F‚Äù material?**
20. **Might future leaks or whistleblowers clarify whether FLYBY is indeed part of a bigger classified library?**

**Author‚Äôs Note**  
This footage remains a favorite among UFO enthusiasts for its closeness to the craft and the possibility it‚Äôs genuine. However, without verifiable metadata or official acknowledgment, it remains in a gray area‚Äî**either an extraordinary genuine leak or a meticulously crafted hoax**. The speculation about a ‚ÄúUAPTF Comms Log‚Äù adds another layer of mystery.

On May 14th, 2008. A perplexing and enigmatic 22nd clip supposedly depicting a disc shaped UFO moving alongside a jet, appeared out of the blue on YouTube. This video was uploaded by a long dead channel titled Danny Lampkin in the video description. Lampkin says one simple sentence quote Im not too sure about this one, but I thought I would download it anyway for you to decide.

00;00;51;02 - 00;01;16;03
Unknown
Okay, I can probably guess what you're thinking right now. This video is far too fantastic to be true. The quality is garbage. This is bad CGI. Or just a model on a string. But this footage is far more complex and scintillating than initially meets the eye. Let's dive in and try to determine the authenticity of the fly by UFO footage.

00;01;16;05 - 00;01;40;11
Unknown
Guys, welcome back to the channel. I'm your host, UAP group. Let's dive right into this today, because I want to dissect one of my favorite pieces of UFO footage that has kept me pondering for the better part of a decade. The flyby footage. If this footage is the real deal, it is the best example of a closely filmed UFO encounter in the entire public realm.

00;01;40;13 - 00;02;04;27
Unknown
Former Aatip director Lou Elizondo once stated there is UFO footage leaked to the public realm that he was shocked had not broken Global News. We can only assume this footage has been seen, but labeled fake or skipped over by the UFO community and internet at large. During an interview with GQ in 2021, when asked about the gimbal go fast and UFO Pentagon videos.

00;02;04;29 - 00;02;27;00
Unknown
Lue stated that these three videos were some of the least compelling out there. And that quote, there's videos out there in government that the public haven't seen yet. There's one that's 23 minutes long. There's another one where this thing is 50ft away from the cockpit. I mean, it ain't ours. We know that sometimes. You just couldn't believe it.

00;02;27;03 - 00;02;54;06
Unknown
Or 99% sure it's not for adversarial technology. So that only leaves really one. One other option. It's someone or something else. Are these three videos the only videos that you know of that the United States government has? It shows unidentified aerial phenomena. No. Absolutely not. These are probably some of the least compelling videos. Some cases, you know, we've seen these things 50ft away from the cockpit on a Joe Rogan Experience appearance.

00;02;54;06 - 00;03;19;23
Unknown
Christopher Mellon, the former deputy assistant secretary of defense staff director of the Senate Intelligence Committee, stated he had seen footage of a UAP right next to a pilot. I'm not sure if this is the same footage Lou is referencing, but I am 100% positive. The footage Mellen was referring to is not the fly by footage, but we are now faced with the mind melting fact.

00;03;19;23 - 00;03;49;17
Unknown
There are real instances of UFOs traveling within 15m of aircraft. So let's start to break down this clip. I can only trace this case back to around April of 2008, where it was posted on the UFO chronicles.com titled quote Flying saucer UFO filmed from jet window. The video then began popping up onto YouTube around May 2008. Unfortunately, I cannot find any record of this clip before April of oh eight.

00;03;49;19 - 00;03;56;16
Unknown
So this is where our trail starts.

00;03;56;19 - 00;04;21;19
Unknown
At a brief glance, we can see this video is certainly under two ¬£0.40, but what we are actually looking at is a recording of a screen meaning someone recorded the original footage plane on a computer screen. So this is a second generation recording. If we look closely, we can see the reflection of equipment. One possibility is the reflection of the camera utilized to record the camera screen.

00;04;21;21 - 00;04;43;12
Unknown
More likely, however, these are reflections of possible objects within the plane's cockpit reflecting against the glass. This would likely be a camcorder positioned inside the cockpit, with possible additional reflective catches of a Gentex Ambu 23 PE pilot respirator mask.

00;04;43;14 - 00;05;09;28
Unknown
Following these possibilities, we must now consider. This footage is taken from inside a military jet and not commercial airliner. Well, one such craft exists that has an interior mounted camera. The NASA F-18 variant, the NASA chase F-18 a as seen here. The jet has a mounted camcorder behind the pilot's seat, able to film starboard or portside without obstruction.

00;05;10;00 - 00;05;31;11
Unknown
In our video, we see what looks to be a jet wing filmed portside with empty missile wingtip pylons. Take a look at this cockpit view of an F-18 Super Hornet. The wing angle matches and so do the wing tip pylons.

00;05;31;14 - 00;06;01;26
Unknown
Okay, what about the audio of this footage? We can hear a loud, muffled noise and possibly human voices within the video. I see two possibilities here. One, the footage features original sound recorded from the pilot, played back on a device and rerecorded from the secondary camera. Recording. The computer screen. The audio could be pure or combined with ambient background noise from the computer recording, or two ambient sounds from the screen recording location.

00;06;01;28 - 00;06;25;17
Unknown
Speculating on possibility to the audio sounds extremely similar to the 2019 U.S. Navy filmed spherical shaped UFO object going into water. Posted by Jeremy Corbell Featuring ambient sounds from the USS Nimitz. Check out this comparison.

00;06;25;19 - 00;06;45;21
Unknown
To the.

00;06;45;24 - 00;06;50;22
Unknown
Rough.

00;06;50;25 - 00;07;09;05
Unknown
To think about possibility, one hears the ambient noise inside the cockpit of an F-18 Super Hornet. And our footage.

00;07;09;08 - 00;07;29;23
Unknown
As one Reddit user pointed out, the audio waveform does not cut a second for of our video where there is a footage cut, leading credence to the possibility that whatever we hear is, in fact ambient noise of a ship where the screen recording was captured. Lastly, audio wise, you might be able to hear faint voices in the background.

00;07;29;26 - 00;07;54;27
Unknown
This same Reddit user attempted to isolate the voices, and here is what they came up with.

00;07;55;00 - 00;08;07;02
Unknown
I cannot even begin to guess what is being said. However, this does appear to be a female voice.

00;08;07;04 - 00;08;33;29
Unknown
Quickly, I wanted to brush over the craft depicted in this video. This UFO is almost identical to the saucer shaped craft as described by Lieutenant Jacobs in his warhead shootdown footage. This craft also appears to be extremely similar to some of the most famous UFO photographs ever taken. The McMinnville photos notice the protrusion on top of the craft, which, as described by Jacobs, is similar to half of a ping pong ball.

00;08;34;02 - 00;09;02;29
Unknown
This same upper protrusion is also seen in the McMinnville images. The craft here also flies at an angle, something seen in numerous saucer images and descriptions of saucer encounters. Controversy. As he is, even Bob Lazar claimed the disc shaped craft fly quote belly towards their destination.

00;09;03;02 - 00;09;33;01
Unknown
Oh boy, here we go. Lastly, I want to talk about the most enigmatic connection to this case in 2000, 2021 or 22, an alleged leaked classified military communications log made its way around the internet, including a post on the ever famous for Chan. Now, everything from Fort Chan must be taken with a grain of salt, but these leaked comms are purportedly a page of a longer classified version of a UAP task force report prepared for Congress.

00;09;33;03 - 00;09;58;21
Unknown
Let's break down this comms log. The log details the cockpit voice recording of a fighter aircraft club. One one during an interception directed by WACs Airborne Warning and Control System callsign Brigham, which serves as a flying long range radar and command center that provides tactical commands services to units in their network. Think of eyes in the Sky for fighter units.

00;09;58;24 - 00;10;23;13
Unknown
And lastly BLK. Unclear what this is. They do not identify themselves, but they use NATO brevity language. The fighter is crewed by a pilot, PC and weapon system operator also sitting in the back and managing some systems. Think back to the NASA chase F-18 The dual seater BLK is guiding them to intercept a bogey seen on radar.

00;10;23;15 - 00;10;46;09
Unknown
The fighter can't see this bogie initially, but at some point the WSO catches it in his radar and tells the pilot it's coming at them. At 2820 knots. Electronic countermeasures are activated and the crew is alerted that a missile has been launched at them, or that they are being actively tracked by radar. This could have been done manually or automatic.

00;10;46;11 - 00;11;09;03
Unknown
The bogey gets so close that from blk point of view, both contacts quote merge meaning they are overlapping at the current resolution and the fighters crew have had no visual contact yet they declared the target as quote bogey dope. When the crew confirms that they see nothing, they ask for further instructions from BLK, who tells them to standby.

00;11;09;06 - 00;11;37;27
Unknown
The crew then see an object on the starboard wing quote, hanging out about 10 to 15ft from the canopy. The pilot is shocked, however, BLK tells them not to change velocity or vector. BLK tells the crew to quote, open your blue envelopes and snooze. Essentially telling the crew to confirm their weapons are off and then to open an envelope and proceed with briefed mission control procedures, which may include radio silence or channel changes.

00;11;38;00 - 00;12;01;25
Unknown
The described events in this comms log line up almost exactly, with the bogies seen off the starboard wing of our F-18 in our video, does it not? But is this document real and does it describe our fly by sighting? Our footages connection to this comms log starts to dive into a deep rabbit hole. And stay with me here.

00;12;01;27 - 00;12;30;13
Unknown
If this is indeed an online Larp, it was constructed by someone who is very familiar with pilot lingo. As we talked about, this page is purportedly a leaked page from an appendix of the longer classified version of the UAP Task Force report. Look at the top of this page. Appendix F for B13 from page 508. Well, there is another alleged page from this leaked document.

00;12;30;15 - 00;13;03;10
Unknown
Section five Behavioral Data Analysis details 1292 UFO cases by the joint elements of Odni, NSA, and SAP. Cleared experts by the DoD. What is absolutely insane about this document are the conclusions presented on this page that some U.A., MSP, unidentified aerial slash submerged phenomena. This, in my opinion, gives little credence to the document giving the distinction between aerial and submerge.

00;13;03;10 - 00;13;38;18
Unknown
But anyways, that these conclusions result that UAP are either remote or autonomous. Drones are a form of mechanical life. This document asserts that an organic species has been deploying UAS sp that have seen a rapid increase in flight performance, indicating a stepped virtual evolution process. According to one mentions Shiba Koya, gradual changes in the UAS sp appearance and behavior highlight generational changes.

00;13;38;20 - 00;14;06;16
Unknown
I have done an exhaustive search into the names mentioned on this page. M Harman, S McCarron and K Shiba Koya and the quote blackout flower report and quote layer three behavioral assessment. But I have found almost nothing. We have to assume these are pseudonyms used or first names of these people removed entirely. My only luck has been able to find one.

00;14;06;16 - 00;14;42;03
Unknown
Hillary S McCarron, whose LinkedIn page features her as a research neuroscientist at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense. As a neuroscientist, her hand featured on a page allegedly studying UFO behavior fits. I'll be doing more investigation here. But, guys, if I am disappeared, you know why? At the bottom of the page featuring the names and reports, look at appendix F, section four be titled D.O.D., 1992 through 2017.

00;14;42;03 - 00;15;11;25
Unknown
High value witness interviews. Real or faked. Our comms log is featured in this section five Behavioral Data Analysis. These are both featured in the same allegedly leaked document. The latest contribution to this report was from Casey McCoy in 2020, and during this time, the UAP Task Force was still running 2017 to 22. So possibly this is an internal report from the UAP Task Force.

00;15;11;27 - 00;15;40;21
Unknown
Could this alleged report be true and subsequent appendix, comm log detail or flyby footage as a, quote, high value witness testimony? If so, that makes our flyby footage one of the most crucial pieces of UFO footage ever taken. But still, this footage remains so anomalous. What's up guys? It's UAP Gerb. Thank you for joining me today. Look, I'm sorry, I'm a little bit disheveled.

00;15;40;23 - 00;15;57;20
Unknown
I just got back from training, but I wanted to wrap this video up and see what you guys think about this fly by case. I wanted to take a quick break from some of our more documentary style fact analysis and do a little speculation, but, you know, with me, we don't just speculate. We try to break everything down.

00;15;57;22 - 00;16;21;17
Unknown
Unfortunately, I'm not a CGI expert. I have no experience. And, any sort of CGI or much kind of in-depth video editing. So if you do and you can perform an analysis on this fly by footage, try to determine if, in fact, this video has some sort of CGI, some clipping, some differential frame rate between the object and the ambient picture.

00;16;21;19 - 00;16;38;17
Unknown
Get in contact with me at UAP gerb at gmail.com and let me know. And maybe you and I can make a part two to this case and crisp it up. Because as it stands right now, this case is incredibly anomalous. And as you've seen, there's a pretty wild rabbit hole behind this case, especially with the supposed UAP, WTF leaked documents.

00;16;38;18 - 00;16;57;16
Unknown
So let me know what you think about this case. I know the footage seems a little too good to be true, but at the end of the day, we don't know if it is very well. Could be. So thank you for joining me. Remember to like and subscribe. Let me know what you thought and I will catch you guys next time.
