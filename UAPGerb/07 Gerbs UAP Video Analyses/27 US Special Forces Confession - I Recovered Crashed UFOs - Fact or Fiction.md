In March of 2024. The infographics show a popular and excellent channel with custom animations and fantastic storytelling, posted a video titled U.S. Special Forces Confession I recovered crashed UFOs. Although the channel has covered the UAP subject in the past, this entry stood out entirely. The video covers the testimony of an individual who encountered a crashed UAP while serving in Vietnam.

00;00;26;27 - 00;00;55;05
Unknown
With engaging storytelling and mesmerizing animations, the infographics team highlights how this sighting saw the soldier read into covert UAP operations and details his work on the program. Astonishing details of UAP crash retrieval and reverse engineering are highlighted in this account, very similar to the claims of David Grush. I'm sure many people saw this video, enjoyed it and moved on just as many watched it and thought, I wonder if this is real?

00;00;55;11 - 00;01;18;22
Unknown
But the narrator starts this video with a statement that almost forces us to analyze the entire video, line by line. Note the following is based on testimony provided over a series of interviews and written correspondence. Edited and cut together in an attempt to create a cohesive timeline of the events as described. Do these events recount the experience of a real anonymous whistleblower?

00;01;18;23 - 00;01;42;16
Unknown
Is this story rooted in fact, and are there elements we can verify? And why did he speak to the Infographics show? Hey guys, it's UAP Gerb and thank you for joining me. As we conduct a full breakdown and analysis of the infographics, shows U.S. Special Forces confession I recovered UFOs since its release. I have played this testimony over and over and over in my head.

00;01;42;16 - 00;02;04;29
Unknown
Is it possible that these events and details recount the true testimony of someone on a UFO crash retrieval program? I think it is well worth investigating their story. Searching for holes or confirmable elements, because this could very well be the most crucial firsthand whistleblower of all time.

00;02;05;01 - 00;02;34;00
Unknown
To start, our witness states and I will be calling him our witness for the duration of this video that our story begins in 1968 during the Vietnam conflict along the Vietnam Cambodia border. Before we get into his story, we do have two interesting Vietnam cases that may be contextually relevant to our infographics. Whistleblower. We can check in on the ever relevant Stephen Greer redacted witness log to analyze the statements and emails of witness ten 622 ten 622.

00;02;34;00 - 00;03;04;09
Unknown
Served as CTR Communication Technician radio in the US Navy from 1966 to 1970 on the Bonhomme Richard aircraft carrier. It was in June of 1968 on official duties. He received scrambled messages mentioning at least 11 UAP were tracked on visual and radar, and on September 9th, 1968, several U.S. helicopter pilots and soldiers stationed at a marine Corps base in Dong Ha, Vietnam had a close encounter with a fast moving object.

00;03;04;11 - 00;03;27;03
Unknown
This object had green and white lights and engaged in maneuvers for 20 minutes. Anyways, our witness states his US military unit was performing an LRP, a long range reconnaissance patrol tracking supply routes into South Vietnam from Cambodia, as well as marking out sites for a B-52 bombing raid the following year. This tiny snippet in the video gives us so much to unpack.

00;03;27;04 - 00;03;52;19
Unknown
The following year of 1969, a covert bombing raid did in fact occur. On March 18th, 1969, the Strategic Air Command commenced Operation Menu, not declassified until 2000 by president Bill Clinton. Operation menu was a year long B-52 bombing campaign that ravaged eastern Cambodia, and that mentioned LRP may be one of the most significant pieces to solving this puzzle.

00;03;52;22 - 00;04;24;24
Unknown
Long Range Reconnaissance Patrol was a special unit acting in Vietnam. Company E, 52nd Infantry, attached to the first Calvary Division in the US Army. This unit operated in Vietnam from 1967 to 1969, well within the time frame of Our Witness, and participated in two of the largest battles of Vietnam, the Tet Offensive and Siege of Kazan. In late October of 1968, company E, 52nd Infantry was relocated and headquartered at Suffolk, then north of Vietnam.

00;04;24;27 - 00;04;50;09
Unknown
The division's area of operations was designated along the Cambodian border in Tainan, been long and Fork Long Provinces, all in South Vietnam. Quote. These areas contain significant routes for enemy infiltration into the Saigon area from Cambodia. So if our witness is telling the truth and this crash is real, this event occurred in October to December 1968 within the company E, 52nd Infantry.

00;04;50;09 - 00;05;16;08
Unknown
LRA ARP stationed out a full arc bin. So far, his testimony lines up exactly with real events. And finally, back to our story. A quote unquote object appeared overhead, the witness and his platoon emitting a bright red orange glow appearing to be melting. The object quickly moved out of sight, but only 5 or 6 seconds later, a large crash followed by a dull thump reverberated throughout the jungle.

00;05;16;11 - 00;05;39;11
Unknown
The platoon figured this must have been a US plane, so knowing better than to risk long range radio communications being intercepted by Soviet agents, they moved to secure the crash site. Arriving at the site, the platoon knew immediately this was not a US playing classified or acknowledged. The only prosaic explanation the soldiers could think of was a crash space probe, something from NASA or the Soviets.

00;05;39;14 - 00;06;03;07
Unknown
The craft was egg shaped, dull gray and metallic, and seemingly cracked open. Again, we see the description. This craft appeared to be made from a single piece of metal with no bolts, seams or screws. This sighting and craft description give us a lot to work off of. Actually, what immediately stands out to me is this red orange glow the craft emanated while flying over the jungle.

00;06;03;07 - 00;06;26;06
Unknown
There are two cases within our crash's time frame that are worth mentioning that are similar to this. We can look to November 22nd of 1968 to nightcap case 681122. On this date in Albany, Georgia, a glowing yellow white oval UFO was seen from a car, directed a light beam at the vehicle and flew away, changing colors to red and orange.

00;06;26;08 - 00;06;56;04
Unknown
And let's head to move France. On December 15th, 1968, reporting in a book translated as UFO, the first complete file on Close Encounters in France, we can find a case where an egg shaped object the size of a car moved quickly without making noise emanating orange reflections. But let's not forget an event that occurred just a year earlier on March 24th, 1967, highlighted in the sworn affidavit by Captain Robert Sallis and others at Malmstrom Air Force Base.

00;06;56;07 - 00;07;17;12
Unknown
I covered this case in my UFO and nukes video, but this event saw a red orange oval UAP appear over the base, disabling the ICBMs of Malmstrom, and this mention of an egg shaped object comes up again and again and again in ufology. We will talk about this more later in the video with the witnesses experience within the program.

00;07;17;14 - 00;07;37;29
Unknown
But let's look at the testimony of aerospace contractor Eric Taper to Arrow, who recounted an egg shaped metallic UFO being kept at area 51 in the 1980s. The description of this craft is almost identical to the Vietnam encounter. And lastly, the molten feel of the craft reminds me closely of the mother of pearl effect displayed on the skin of the craft.

00;07;37;29 - 00;08;01;23
Unknown
Lance Corporal of Jonathan Wagon claimed to have observed in the jungles of Peru. In 1997, our platoon of Marines called in the crash, only to hear there were already birds in route and ordered to secure the crash quickly. A pair of F-4 jets fell into orbit overhead. The mention of the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom 2nd May seem small, but this is actually a huge detail in our story.

00;08;01;25 - 00;08;26;11
Unknown
In June of 1986, former Bethel Corps contractor James Mac Campbell told ufologist Jock the Late he met with a military contact with the Wild Weasels, a codename given by USAF for aircraft equipped with anti-radiation missiles and tasked with the suppression of enemy air defenses in Vietnam. This contractor told the Campbell F-4 jets were equipped with M detection equipment to detect UAP.

00;08;26;11 - 00;08;52;26
Unknown
During the war, Doctor Steven Greer may have an additional witness, adding valuable context. These F-4 claims witness ten 272 claims to have worked for a UK based contractor installing low observable radar assemblies on F-4 fighters at area 51. Along with these claims, the witness alleges to have been involved in the evaluation of hardware from night craft anyways, Infantry then touched down and acted in perimeter security.

00;08;52;26 - 00;09;13;04
Unknown
But I want to note the witness states they were allowed nowhere near the craft. They were deployed in a wide swath. It took two days for the craft to be removed from the jungle, all with the help of SOF special operations forces, Navy and Air Force officials on site who had already been read into the program. The mention of the Air Force is no surprise here.

00;09;13;06 - 00;09;39;09
Unknown
Ever since the 1947 Roswell, New Mexico crash and the involvement of USAF general Roger Ramey, the Air Force has long been entwined with the study of UAP. Again, I would like to recommend my Moondust video and Yousuf document AFC one draft policy, which states project UFO and Moon Dust, both headquartered out of the Air Force, have collection responsibilities for UAP and descended foreign space vehicles.

00;09;39;12 - 00;10;07;16
Unknown
The Navy is a bit more interesting. Sure, we have Rear Admiral Timothy Gallaudet, who speaks openly about UAP and op nav regulations to restrict UAP reporting I covered in my USO videos, but I can't help thinking about the Wilson Davis memo. After all, if this memo is true, which I fully believe it is, Dia Director and Vice Admiral Thomas Wilson was stonewalled from reading into the program.

00;10;07;19 - 00;10;32;13
Unknown
This was our witnesses first ever interaction with the program throughout Vietnam. Several rapid reaction units were on standby for retrieval purposes. And it's here the witness adds some interesting context, and that's what everyone called it, the program. And there were several rapid reaction unit stationed throughout in theater C, we learned from the Korean War that these things are attracted to conflict, and I guess that it makes sense.

00;10;32;19 - 00;10;56;16
Unknown
It's probably one of the most interesting things we do. A lot of people think this whole mess started in World War two, and maybe it did, but the program got put together during the Korean War, and that's when it was official. The Korean War lasted from 1950 to 1953, while the first U.S. based retrieval of a UAP occurred in Roswell in 1947, it is possible the program took a few years to put together.

00;10;56;19 - 00;11;32;05
Unknown
If we are going to believe the MG 12 documents the program in charge of UAP investigation, crash retrieval and reverse engineering operated under US President Truman and briefed President Eisenhower, who took office in 53. This means the program was put together during 1945, more like 1947 to 1950. Fitting in nicely with the realm of the Korean War, we can, of course, guess the program was already implemented by 1950, when senior radio engineers wrote to the Canadian Controller of Telecommunications in the Department of Transport stating the U.S. was actively engaged in studying UAP.

00;11;32;05 - 00;11;58;05
Unknown
In an effort so classified it rated even higher than the H-bomb. This information was provided to the engineer Wilbert B Smith by physicist and member of the U.S. Research and Development Board and student under Einstein, Robert SA Barker. I highly recommend my video on this subject, as it very well may cover the early days of the program. The witness also states quote, these things are attracted to conflict, end quote.

00;11;58;08 - 00;12;31;12
Unknown
Well, we know from numerous stories, including Robert Sallis and Malmstrom Air Force Base, UAP have a direct interest in observing and interact with nuclear arms. We know from the testimony of Bob Jacobs, UAP have even an interest in dummy flights of ICBMs. And if the 1953 Kingman, Arizona crash is true, let's remember this happening during Operation Upshot Knothole, which oversaw extensive nuclear testing and certainly looks like they want to understand how far we've advanced in our nuclear fizzle kind of technologies.

00;12;31;12 - 00;12;57;10
Unknown
At the very least. I mean, it looks like preparatory probing activity. It might be innocent kind of scientific gathering could be ISR probing. Anyways, it was at this time the witness and his fellow platoon mates were read into the program. Joining the program was by force. The soldiers were faced with this or a general discharge, likely drug charges or an article 15 which gives military commanders an easy way to punish minor infractions.

00;12;57;10 - 00;13;29;11
Unknown
Breaching military conduct. This draws my attention to an alleged crash retrieval that occurred on April 12th in 1954, relayed to Leonard Stringfield by a witness. CA you can read about this in Springfield's UFO Crash Retrieval Status Report three. Amassing the evidence. And the link, of course, will be in the description. In this incident, CA and a USAF Crew rescue four out of Roswell Air Force Base were dispatched to a site 25 to 30 miles northwest, where they observed a metallic saucer crashed edgewise into the sand with a dome in its center.

00;13;29;13 - 00;13;54;22
Unknown
A ground crew in fatigues was already at. This site, prevented the men from getting closer, and began tagging debris and scattered in high bodies. Kay returned to Roswell, was debriefed for three days in a quote unquote living hell, and told by men identifying as intelligence officers in civilian clothes not to speak about the incident. Reading to CA, a law that referred to a fine, imprisonment with hard labor and general discharge.

00;13;54;25 - 00;14;19;12
Unknown
Our witness states his introduction to the program was highly compartmentalized. He was only told what he needed to know. This mirrors accurately the compartmentalization discussed in the Wilson Davis memo. The four programs that referred Admiral Wilson to the program were, quote, part of it in different compartments placed in different layers of the compartments. Pyramid split up to do different things of parts of it.

00;14;19;15 - 00;14;48;24
Unknown
It is interesting to hear a witness state. I didn't even realize those damn things were from space until I actually saw a body. So some of these craft are indeed from space and some are manned vessels. We know from my Fast Walker video, there is factual evidence USG elements had a term for objects entering or leaving Earth's atmosphere, denoted as fast walkers and defense support satellites were likely used to monitor these objects, and the subject of bodies can be pretty contentious.

00;14;48;27 - 00;15;16;21
Unknown
But like David said, well, naturally, when you recover something that's either landed or crashed, sometimes you encounter, dead pilots and, believe it or not, as as fantastical as that sounds, it's true, the witness states. The more he figured out, the more he was read into the program. He never learned all the truth, but knew enough he felt compelled to come forward, especially as an aging gentleman serving in Vietnam.

00;15;16;21 - 00;15;41;09
Unknown
I would put this individual's age at around 74 or older and claiming he had been out of the program for 20 years means his service in the program occurred from around 1969 to 2004. The witness even discusses David Grush commenting on his approach to speaking publicly and labeling him a patriot. He even confirmed the involvement of aerospace contractors in sophisticated disinformation.

00;15;41;11 - 00;16;04;11
Unknown
I don't think we need to expand on these topics too much in general, as I have multiple videos exploring the full involvement of Lockheed Martin and Battelle Memorial Institute's interaction with UAP, and fully covered the birth of the UAP stigma. Check out those videos for some valuable context here. After being read into the program, the witnesses unit was put back on duty but broken up and placed in horrific combat engagements.

00;16;04;14 - 00;16;28;18
Unknown
Five of the original 12 died in combat. I know five of the original 12 died in combat, three more badly wounded. I think they were trying to kill us off. If this broken up team still served with the first Calvary Division LRP, we may in fact be able to track these names. Of the 1000 men who served in this unit, 45 were killed in Vietnam, in Cambodia and the witness state.

00;16;28;18 - 00;16;49;27
Unknown
A year after the initial crash, he was officially brought into the program, where his primary job was no longer being a soldier, but he was now part of the program. So with this information, we can conclude that these soldiers were killed between October to December of 1968, where the crash occurred in October to December of 1969, when he was brought into the program.

00;16;50;04 - 00;17;14;03
Unknown
And we'll give an error factor of around plus or minus, let's say three months. I have actually found a memorial site dedicated to those served and fell in the LRP unit within the first Calvary Division. Analyzing the casualty list, we can try and trace the deaths of these brave soldiers from the time of our crash. October to December 68th, and our witness being read into the program October to December 1969.

00;17;14;08 - 00;17;37;23
Unknown
So we're left with 16 possible names if we filter out soldiers who died of non-hostile actions, we are left with eight possible names. If our witness is telling the truth, five of eight of these names are likely platoon mates of his who observed the crashed egg shaped UAP. It didn't happen often, but these things did fall out of the sky where people would see something, land or witness.

00;17;37;23 - 00;17;55;24
Unknown
Beings happening more often than people know, and we'd swoop in as fast as we could in case there was anything to snatch up. I think we pulled three total craft out of theater and not just Vietnam. Damn near started a war with China and one recovery up to three craft in Vietnam. Well, perhaps there are others who can expand on this.

00;17;55;24 - 00;18;21;28
Unknown
Within Stephen Greer's redacted witness list, we returned to again and again and again we find witness ten six, five, nine, quote, firsthand involvement in Vietnam, crash retrieval of ET craft involved directly with ET technology posse to other military UFO events, including dad's presence at 1954 Edwards Air Force Base. UFO landing. I do think this witness is separate from our infographics witness.

00;18;21;28 - 00;18;53;21
Unknown
Due to the claims of dad's presence at a 1954 Edwards AFB landing, the witness comments how one retrieval almost started a war with China, the program only getting the upper hand due to China's primitive early warning systems. David Grotius commented on this a multi-decade, long cold war between the U.S, China and other U.S adversaries. We're in a competition with their adversaries to understand this, and it's, it's a multi-decade Cold War that, has been under our nose for so long.

00;18;53;21 - 00;19;18;01
Unknown
And, you know, there is no good way to level the playing field and hold other nation states accountable if they're doing unethical or illicit activity as it relates to the subject. And I think the two secrecy is actually putting us in a very dangerous position where, a country might make a breakthrough that say we, that's an adversary of ours.

00;19;18;03 - 00;19;46;09
Unknown
And it is so destabilizing. You say there's been a Cold War behind the scenes with Russia and China. There has been a Cold War against her, with her, with her professors. Yeah. The witness also states recoveries in the ocean would be near impossible, that Europe was another hotspot for UFO activity. This was due to curiosity towards the always militarized European mainland, especially within the Cold War and a few decades removed from World War Two.

00;19;46;11 - 00;19;59;16
Unknown
Europe was able to keep a tighter lid on the subject, especially with the European populace, quote, turning their nose up at the whole UFO thing and quote.

00;19;59;19 - 00;20;24;20
Unknown
The crafts themselves were extraordinary. That's the only way to describe them. I wasn't there for every single recovery, obviously, but they kept collections of them in different places, and I got to see two of the collections. The question of craft housing and material handling is done is always fascinating, starting with a quote unquote collection of craft. As we know from David Grush, the USG is in possession of up to 12 to 15 craft.

00;20;24;22 - 00;21;05;10
Unknown
When you say crash retrieval, what do you mean? These are retrieving non-human origin, technical vehicles, you know, call it spacecraft, if you will, non-human exotic origin vehicles that have either landed or crashed. We have spacecraft from another species. We do? Yeah. How many? Quite a number. You're kidding. No. These claims have been echoed by numerous whistleblowers, including alleged S-4 Project Aquarius biologist Dan Barish sit tight for a video on him, but he claimed nine hangar bays housed UAP and reverse engineered vehicles, including the 1953 Kingman, Arizona crash.

00;21;05;10 - 00;21;43;00
Unknown
At S-4, the witness states Wright-Patterson and the Foreign Technology Division is a red herring that this is where the Soviets would have immediately come looking. Quote. We faked some stuff going into Wright-Patterson and quote, it's likely in the early days of the program. Right. Pat housed both crashes and biological material, and we only have to look at Roswell to guess that this means that either before or during the witnesses tenure in the program, program duties shifted away from the air base and any sort of material or crash sighting at right pat from roughly 1969 to 2004 are hoaxes perpetrated by the program.

00;21;43;03 - 00;22;05;29
Unknown
Now, there is some conflicting information here, as I think back to the testimony of Senator Barry Goldwater, who in 1975 was stonewalled by General Curtis LeMay into accessing the Blue Room at right Pat where UAP information and materials were likely stored. Possibly this means right Pat held a database or record of UAP in program activity, but not actual materials and biologics.

00;22;06;02 - 00;22;27;05
Unknown
There were these co-op sites run by the government and the big defense contractors, people like Raytheon, Boeing, everyone knows their names, but also people like Texas Instruments. It was a whole umbrella, but the little guys only got a tiny piece of the puzzle. Some guys from tie would get a piece of something and then be asked to figure out how it works, never being told where it came from.

00;22;27;10 - 00;22;49;25
Unknown
And on its own. I'm sure these eggheads had their suspicions, but it's hard to tell if something's actually alien. Raytheon, Boeing, and Texas Instruments are specifically named dropped, and we can infer T is one of the quote unquote little guys mentioned here. As the witness proposes the example of t getting a little piece of something. Can we find one interesting connection for each of these three companies?

00;22;49;28 - 00;23;24;14
Unknown
Well, to start, we can find Raytheon Namedrop, specifically alongside Lockheed Martin Aerospace Corp, TRW, etc., by Lockheed Martin astrophysicist Bernard Hayes as one of a major aerospace company in which the legacy UAP programs hide. In 1956, Boeing was mentioned in a special weapons study of aviation studies examination of electro gravity systems. This piece references a project, Winter Haven, which suggests construction of a saucer, creating a local gravitational field designated to serve as a USAF interceptor.

00;23;24;17 - 00;23;58;17
Unknown
Boeing was one such company mentioned on working on these anti-gravity rigs. When we hear Texas Instruments, we think of the tire 84 calculator that got me through college. At least I do. But t also operates within the aerospace and defense industries. Unfortunately, there is not much to confirm here, as the only link to Tia I can find is a 1961 establishment of the Southwest Center for Advanced Studies by T to work on gravity, physics.

00;23;58;20 - 00;24;19;22
Unknown
And finally, on to everybody's favorite subject, the craft. The witness makes a very curious claim. Although he knows these craft can operate in a microgravity medium, he does not know if they are really spacecraft and wonders if that's where they want us to think they are coming from. End quote. The witness comments. Ufology has done a pretty good job at compiling craft shape.

So you got your flying eggs, your Tic Tacs, I guess you now call them. We just call them pills. Your old fashioned saucers, bells, triangles, whole message shapes. But the ones that crash are almost always the eggs and the bells in arrows. Data from 1996 to 2023. We can actually find the most commonly reported UAP configurations factoring out spheres and lights, which in my opinion, often have a more possible prosaic explanation than other configurations.

00;24;47;01 - 00;25;11;11
Unknown
As we can see, commonly cited craft shapes accurately reflect our witnesses list. Eggs and bell shapes are the most frequently crashed objects, according to our witness, sometimes disintegrating on impact and our witness claims these are likely unmanned drones. We have already covered some really interesting and possibly credible eggs and oval shaped objects. Eric Tabor and Jonathan Wiegand. But what about this bell?

00;25;11;13 - 00;25;33;20
Unknown
There is a fascinating and perplexing case that occurred in 1965. In Kecksburg, Pennsylvania. I plan to cover soon. Allegedly, a bell shaped, almost acorn object crashed in the area. This case was covered extensively by Leonard Stringfield, so if you'd like to brush up before my video, I recommend reading his UFO Crash Retrievals, The Inner Sanctum Status Report six.

00;25;33;27 - 00;26;01;29
Unknown
And if you remember from my Robert SA Baker video, Doctor Eric Walker, an alleged original program manager, claimed to have been on site and at location for this crashed object. Our witness declares the saucer of the Crown Jewels and he only ever participate in the recovery of two such craft. I probably don't need to dive too much into the importance of disks or saucers in UFO lore, but let's see if we can investigate the witnesses aid in a crash retrieval in South America.

00;26;02;02 - 00;26;21;17
Unknown
The saucer. We've recovered and hit the side of a rocky outcropping on its way down. It smashed the rock to pieces, then took out a quarter mile of trees. If it had happened on the outskirts of civilization, the whole UFO mystery would have been public knowledge by now. That's how much destruction that thing cost. But the craft itself was relatively unharmed.

00;26;21;19 - 00;26;46;27
Unknown
I will be using the date frame 1969 to 2004. I derived earlier for our witnesses time in the program. I can find three relevant cases for my all time favorite crash retrieval handbook. Magic Eyes. Only by Ryan's would we will not be covering the 1997 Jonathan Wigand Peru case, or the 1978 moon dust retrieval in Bolivia. As these craft are explicitly stated as not saucer like.

00;26;47;00 - 00;27;15;04
Unknown
One example can be found that was also relayed in the notes of Leonard Stringfield dated March 23rd, 1978. In his notes, Stringfield spoke with one Bob Barry, who claimed a UFO crash retrieval occurred on November 11th, 1975, very close to Lima, Peru. This craft was unmanned and measured 12ft high and eight feet in diameter. If what our witness is saying is true and mostly eggs, bells are unmanned, this may not be a saucer, but still worth mentioning.

00;27;15;04 - 00;27;36;18
Unknown
The outer surface was metallic with material deemed to be non-terrestrial. Another possible event occurred in Puerto Rios, Chile, 1978. Pulled from the files of Bob Pratt. Also he learned while in the area. A year later, a tremendous explosion occurred that woke up all 3000 people in the area. All houses shook and everyone thought a blast furnace had exploded.

00;27;36;21 - 00;28;10;15
Unknown
Engineers determined the event was an airburst. The explosion occurred in the air and the blast force exerted downwards. Following the crash, American operatives and NASA coveralls arrived at the scene questioning witnesses. An American or Soviet spacecraft, maybe. But when Bob Pratt filed FOI a request to NASA in the CIA, they responded they had no data on the event, and we could find a third case that's also mentioned in string fields UFO Crash Retrieval Syndrome status report, two new sources, new data, which discusses an October 3rd, 1980 saucer crash in Pedro de la Gea, Argentina.

00;28;10;15 - 00;28;36;23
Unknown
Here, witnesses in a 300 mile radius saw what appeared to be a saucer shaped fireball come down from the skies and explode. Near 7 p.m., some witnesses claimed the fireball flew in circles before crashing, exhibiting intelligent control. Captain Carlos Lima, then head of the Space Research Division of the Argentinian Air Force, officially investigated the incident. He found four burn spots, circular and 10 to 18m in diameter.

00;28;36;25 - 00;29;02;19
Unknown
And notice what appeared to be the product of combustion originated by liquid fuel or some sort of material with a very high temperature. End quote. Could any of these cases, or possibly the Virginia Brazil case so excellently covered by James Fox, be the crash? Our witness mentioned. When the witness reached the administrative side of the program, he learned saucers were formed from a single piece of material or put together at an atomic level.

00;29;02;19 - 00;29;39;27
Unknown
Quote. Even the entrance is invisible until it actually opens and quote, but interiors could be accessed through destructive and nondestructive means. I have recently covered two witnesses whose claims mirror these statements identically. Hams who declared the UFO he observed undergoing inspections at Dugway Proving Ground was, quote, flawless, like it had been 3D printed, and RB, who claimed the saucer he guarded in 1963, had a door panel with tolerances so tight not even a piece of paper could fit through the seams.

00;29;39;29 - 00;30;00;18
Unknown
The first mention of biologics comes with the South American saucer retrieval. Once access was gained to the craft, the interior reeked of decaying organic material. The quote unquote things inside were dead. I call them things on purpose, not out of disrespect or anything like that. I just don't think any of us were ever convinced they were actually living creatures.

00;30;00;21 - 00;30;24;09
Unknown
Well, not in the sense that you and I are. These biologics featured a crude digestive system, only enough to process basic proteins and such, leading the witness and program to believe these things were similar to biological androids. The typical gray alien depicted in media is allegedly accurate, but these beings are a little taller than the famous humanoids and possess large but not massive eyes.

00;30;24;11 - 00;30;53;12
Unknown
The witness remarks how these beings were raised in a dimly lit environment, supported by their dimly lit craft. These creatures feature long limbs and knees. Quote. Not in the right places. End quote. The subject of almost android like living beings has been echoed by many, including Doctor Gary Nolan. I think that part of what we are seeing here, I mean, look, if you are an intelligence, are you going to go down on a planet with a bunch of angry monkeys who might kill you?

00;30;53;16 - 00;31;23;27
Unknown
No. Unlikely. You'll send some intermediary, but what kind of intermediary are you going to send? You're going to send something that maybe almost looks like them, but isn't them? So I think, and this is again from inside the intelligence community, most of what we think we're seeing are avatars, biological robots that are basically put there to be the minions, if you will.

00;31;23;29 - 00;31;47;13
Unknown
And that's that's the current view of that. To me, that is a it is a hypothesis. Living biologics have been recovered by our witness specifically at a near UK based retrieval. This event occurred at the same time of a meteor strike in the UK area. And I actually think I may have found this incident. This story occurred in May of 1996, in Boyle, Ireland.

00;31;47;16 - 00;32;12;02
Unknown
Locals witnessed a meteor or an aerial craft heading towards land, appearing to misjudge its approach, shearing trees and landing in a lake. Allegedly, several occupants were taken into custody by a retrieval team and significant military activity, including American soldiers, continued for the following six months. Even local police were instructed to stay away. The American soldier bit here is key.

00;32;12;02 - 00;32;36;05
Unknown
As our witness states, Europe has a default agreement with the United States that recovered materials go to the U.S but quote, that's the price you pay for having a superpower. Watch your back. At this crash site, the witness states two of five of the craft's crew survived light bruising covered the dead from the hard landing. The program has ruthlessly strict protocols for dealing with live biologics, according to our witness.

00;32;36;07 - 00;33;02;04
Unknown
These rules include never leveling a weapon at a being and for that matter, security is positioned well away and out of sight from the biologics, immediately taking readings to ensure nothing toxic or hazardous is present near the craft, and medical personnel are then sent to the craft area or interior, including a lead doctor known as the ambassador, who always spoke at least English, Chinese, Spanish and Russian.

00;33;02;07 - 00;33;25;11
Unknown
The biologics at this UK crash just stood around aimlessly, solely reacting to basic stimuli as the team entered the craft after the door opened on its own, the beans were even let out of the craft like school children in this instance, and almost any other where live biologics were recovered, the witness remarks. The beans live at most a few days before they keel over dead.

00;33;25;13 - 00;33;51;04
Unknown
These points, alongside the fact that beans could breathe Earth's atmosphere, are used by the witness to support the hypothesis. They are like drones or biological computers. Like Gary Nolan said. Whatever's making these things just creates a biological crew when it needs one, and they do their job and nothing else. At least that was our theory, because their bodies didn't seem built to last, and the eggheads found it suspicious that they were able to breathe our atmosphere so easily.

00;33;51;07 - 00;34;20;19
Unknown
Of course, we do not have access to any living or deceased, no biologics in the public sector. So are there at least any parallels we can draw from the witness? The subject of biologics and their taxonomy is one of the most contentious subjects in the UAP. The visual of the classic gray alien small beings varying in color with a long faded limbs, frail bodies, enlarged head large, two enormous eyes tiny to a non-existent noses and mouths have been echoed since the dawn of UAP lore.

00;34;20;22 - 00;34;46;25
Unknown
From Roswell to Kingman to abductee claims to myriad files in the Leonard Stringfield Files, similar descriptions of non-human biologics pop up everywhere. And this isn't mentioning countless accusations of the program being in possession of living and dead beans. Unfortunately, this is also one of the most lied about and hoaxed aspects of the phenomenon. So for now, we must stick to the direct confirmation of biological retrieval confirmed by Grush.

00;34;46;27 - 00;35;11;05
Unknown
Sometimes you encounter, dead pilots and relate statements of, quote, little gray men whose ships had crashed or had been shot down, being kept on ice by the Air Force Technology Division at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and quote, as stated by former Special Assistant to the Deputy Director of the CIA, Victor Marchetti, our witness goes back to pondering why it is saucers and maybe 1 or 2 other types actually have a manned crew.

00;35;11;05 - 00;35;30;03
Unknown
I'm guessing maybe one of these is the triangular shape. The witness in the program had a theory quote. This was all being fabricated for us, and even tasked NASA to look for where something like a big 3D printer could be in the solar system, some facility or computer, just making these crafts and these things and sending them to Earth.

00;35;30;10 - 00;35;47;12
Unknown
And sometimes they crashed or they just landed and didn't take off, like whatever was doing this wanted us to recover the craft. I don't know if they ever found anything though. There was some excitement for a while. It's hard to hide heat in space and obviously making these crafts on such a large scale would give off a lot of heat.

00;35;47;18 - 00;36;19;02
Unknown
Or maybe not. Maybe they use physics we don't even understand. These are some very charged statements with a lot to unpack. We do know, around the time of our witnesses involvement in the program, NASA openly denied studying UFOs. However, we can find a letter to NASA chief of Ground Operation Safety dated December 13th, 1977. This page, observed only via FOIA request, is directed towards the NASA administrator about UFOs detailing, quote, what could be a piece of a UFO.

00;36;19;02 - 00;36;44;20
Unknown
End quote was examined at Los Alamos for a period of over two months. Additionally, on page 121 and 126 of this Black Vault PDF detailing NASA FOIA requests, we can see an internal memo admit the agency conducted the UFO hard Evidence analysis program titled UFO heap around the late 70s, and this 3D printer has actually a very real basis in 20th century physics.

00;36;44;22 - 00;37;09;06
Unknown
The idea of a universal constructor, or self-replicating automata, was first proposed in the 1940s by physicist John von Neumann, who by the way, was listed as being involved in UFO recovery, along with Vannevar Bush and Robert Oppenheimer by physicist Robert SA Baker. I talked about earlier. His theory explores how a sub faster than light civilization can colonize a galaxy.

00;37;09;09 - 00;37;33;17
Unknown
The automata involve robotic or nano robotic systems that replicate by creating miniature copies of themselves, which grow over time. Such a feat would require an abundance of materials, so maybe this heat signature the witness mentioned occurred near our asteroid belt. But the replicator hub, nestled within the dark regions of a solar system for creating craft. And I guess biologics is an extremely plausible scenario.

00;37;33;20 - 00;38;08;26
Unknown
This even rings identically to the alleged Fortran whistleblower who stated, a UFO replicator lies within our oceans. And these statements by our witness, quote, whatever was doing this wanted us to recover the craft and quote is widely known within ufology as donation craft. This subject has been touched on by David Grush. Call it spacecraft, if you will. Non-human exotic origin vehicles that have either landed or crashed is the subject of Eric Taylor's arrow testimony, as this egg shaped craft was simply found untouched in the desert and features in many corners of ufology.

00;38;08;28 - 00;38;34;14
Unknown
The witness makes multiple mentions to failed in 1990. Successful attempts to down UAP craft. One failure occurred in Iran, and I am almost positive this is the 1976 I ran. Major Jafari case. The successful downing of UAP craft is something I have covered often, including in my last video where witness TPI states the USG developed technology within the star Wars program to down craft.

00;38;34;16 - 00;39;01;17
Unknown
People have been hurt by these craft, according to the witness, but theorizes this is incidental and a byproduct of the craft themselves. Mander unmanned the craft have the ability to distort perception and mess with minds. Quote unquote. Anchors were formed for recovery operatives to keep them grounded in reality. For instance, if you and I were on a security team and approach to craft would say, okay, the craft is resting up against a big oak tree, and there's a gray boulder on the other side.

00;39;01;24 - 00;39;24;26
Unknown
You think of that picture, and it would help with the confusion whenever that effect happened. Kind of warded off. This messing with human cognition has been mentioned extensively by Doctor Gary Nolan, and even mentioned in a tip slide nine leaked from Christopher Mellon's personal website. And lastly, what do they want? The witness doesn't know the program strongly supports the donation theory where the craft are gifted.

00;39;24;29 - 00;39;49;07
Unknown
Maybe the technology is gifted to not cause massive disruption within our own evolution. We had another conclusion though, this one more disturbing. Maybe they just left these crafts lying around because they were easy to build. Hey guys, thank you so much for watching. As I broke down the infographics whistleblower who claim to have first hand experience in the crash retrieval program.

00;39;49;09 - 00;40;20;24
Unknown
My objective of this video was to analyze some of these claims, relate them to ufology at large, as well as try to investigate as much as we could about this whistleblower to see if they're testimony and the individual is fact or fiction. So I think I feel pretty confident in us being able to kind of determine the time frame of this initial event in Vietnam, occurring October to December 1968, in company E, 52nd Infantry, in the first Cavalry Division, LRP, close to Saigon and South Vietnam.

00;40;20;24 - 00;40;52;19
Unknown
Probably fourth Long and I'm pretty confident in five of the 8 or 9 names I may have messed that up. Who following died in combat? After the initial sighting of the UAP from our whistleblower. And I'm also pretty confident in his introduction to the program. October to December 1969 and his years of service, 1969 to 2004. I'm also medium confident on the three South America crashes and Ireland UK crash that occurred in 1996.

00;40;52;19 - 00;41;12;28
Unknown
These are all, not very known cases. Pretty kind of low key, but, you know, these kind of fit, our timetable fit, fit our interest. Fit what we were looking for. So, guys, I do have a theory on who this whistleblower might be. I. Now, this could very well be false. I don't think it holds much water.

00;41;12;28 - 00;41;30;12
Unknown
More so than dates and kind of interesting coincidences. Lining up, because if I had to put money on it, I do think this whistleblower is offering some, true testimony here. I don't think this is as simple as just something, fictitious is a very interesting testimony and a lot of things that line up to ufology at large.

00;41;30;12 - 00;41;58;10
Unknown
But the theory, remember, just a theory. For those of you who watched my last video, The Witness TB do you remember the general that he said showed classified UAP derived cloaking technology in 2004 and was thus investigated, demoted a star and retired this general John Ricks guys, I think it's possible that this whistleblower is this aforementioned general, General John M Ricks.

00;41;58;12 - 00;42;33;18
Unknown
Why do I think that? Well, John M Riggs enlisted in the US Army in 1965, was commissioned a second lieutenant in 1969, and he then went on to achieve 1100 hours of flight time, earning himself a Distinguished Cross. Remember what he said in theater in Vietnam? A rapid reaction unit. This would make sense that if he then got his, flying license in the military helicopter pilot, he would have then served on that rapid reaction unit, possibly providing perimeter security and flying the team there.

00;42;33;21 - 00;42;56;02
Unknown
Right. So his time in the military was 1965 when he enlisted, in 1969, when he was commissioned an officer to 2004 John M Riggs was forced to retire in 2004, 2005. So this lines up exactly with our witnesses ten in the program as well. And our witness states eventually he moved over to the administrative side of the program.

00;42;56;02 - 00;43;25;16
Unknown
Right. Well, John M Riggs was promoted to general. And higher up in the military worked with Congress. He was also stationed at a US Army base in, in, I'm trying to look in in Germany. I'm not quite sure when this is, but this would line up with our U. UK based crash, would it not? Kind of a as our witness says, that Europe is always ready in a constant state of war, that, you know, these objects are attracted to conflict there.

00;43;25;18 - 00;43;58;20
Unknown
Again, this theory doesn't hold much water, but we know that if this story about John M Riggs is true, which I do believe it is because I do with the credibility of Tbese claims. Mr. Riggs is also well aware of UAP drive tech, reverse engineering, and crash retrieval efforts. And let's not forget, once he retired after allegedly showing a BA systems employee classified technology, he went on to then serve as an aviation and strategic defense consultant, so not much besides dates.

00;43;58;22 - 00;44;15;22
Unknown
And I don't want to kick off an investigation I can't control because there's still so much more to investigate with this. But that is my little theory right now. If you guys have watched this and you have another theory, let me know what it is because I'm investigating. I really want to get to the bottom of this because this is such an interesting story.

00;44;15;22 - 00;44;34;23
Unknown
And as we can see, that a 25 minute video takes over 40 minutes to kind of analyze and not just watching the video, right? Like, you guys know, I'm not just, a screencap in the video playing me pausing every couple of minutes and given my thoughts. No, we're linking documents, we're linking cases, we're linking relevant video footage and clips.

00;44;34;23 - 00;44;51;25
Unknown
So yeah, that shows you how much meat is on the bone of this specific case. I think it's enthralling, and I really have tried to get in contact with the infographics team. Everything short of paying, to, to, become a member of theirs to join their discord, which I just might at this point because I really want to find this out.

00;44;51;25 - 00;45;18;14
Unknown
But I hope you guys have just as great of a time kind of sifting through this video as I did and joining me on this venture, as we try to learn more about this whistleblower and determine if this is a real individual and real experience, I know I find the, the biologics, the androids one of the most interesting things ever since Grush came out there last summer of 2023 and talked about biologics.

00;45;18;16 - 00;45;38;17
Unknown
That statement, as he testified to Congress biologics dead pilots, as he said to Russ, cold heart has enthralled me. And and hearing Gary Nolan talk about the hypothesis of biological androids, that's just something I found so interesting. If any of you guys listen to the podcast Mysterious Universe, I think this was back in 2017. I can't remember exactly one.

00;45;38;20 - 00;45;59;28
Unknown
They did a show on this exact subject, kind of like the classic gray being a biological android. So for the better part of a a decade now, I've been thinking about this theory. It's just been so interesting in my head. So, you know, watching this whistleblower say that these biologics are like, children respond to basic stimuli, kill over and dead and die when their purpose is done.

00;45;59;28 - 00;46;12;19
Unknown
It's just so fascinating to me. So in the comments, guys, let me know what you think. Please remember to like and subscribe. Always remember I got a Patreon! If you think the channel is worth anything, I don't gatekeeper the content. Just support what you think the channel is worth. And please let me know what you think.

I'd love to get some more discussion around this video, and I will catch everybody on the next show. Thank you.
