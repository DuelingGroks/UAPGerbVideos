Unknown
David Grush. Robert Jacobs, David Fravor, Robert Sallis, Michael Herrera all UFO whistleblowers who have sworn their testimony before Congress. Testified to arrow or signed legal affidavits to swear in their statements. Bob Lazar, Mark McCandless. Bill Newhouse, Boyd Bushman all UFO whistleblowers with astounding claims persisting throughout the decades but with no real legal testimony or evidence to back them up, the world has seen myriad whistleblowers since the 1940s, and the nine men I just mentioned are just a drop in the bucket.

00;00;35;10 - 00;01;01;12
Unknown
Though these whistleblowers vary greatly in credibility and believability, all of these men and women deserve to be analyzed with a critical lens, regardless of if they are of ironclad reputation and accomplishments like Rush and Fravor possess testimony sworn in to legal record, like Sallis and USMC vet Michael Herrera, or claims that are unverifiable yet intriguing, but have never been sworn in under legal testimony like Lazaro and Bushman.

00;01;01;15 - 00;01;27;02
Unknown
Who knows what whistleblowers with sobering and real testimonies have been overlooked or buried in the annals of UFO lore. Who knows what whistleblowers may give us a peek behind the veil to get a glimpse at the shadowy program that has likely been operating since at least 1947. Hey guys, it's UAP Group, and join me today as I begin part one of an exciting ongoing series studying UFO whistleblowers throughout history.

00;01;27;07 - 00;01;49;27
Unknown
This series will bring light to lesser known whistleblowers I find worthy of discussing and studying. We will investigate the person making the claims and analyze the context of their claims to see if we can start making heads or tails of the astonishing and perplexing stories of firsthand encounters with UAP.

00;01;49;29 - 00;02;16;05
Unknown
We all know the story of the Roswell crash of 1947. Many, including myself, consider this the inflection point the nexus of secret UFO study and crash retrieval and reverse engineering efforts. What can you tell me about the Roswell craft? Fortunately, those details were not approved for me to talk about right now. Everyone knows the general story of Roswell, but here's a quick refresher.

00;02;16;05 - 00;02;41;12
Unknown
And I do mean quick, because Roswell is one of the most fascinating stories in human history and deserves at least a 1 to 2 hour video on its investigation. On July 1st through the third, 1947, UFOs were detected on radar from White Sands Missile Range, which had been testing nuclear weapons since 1946. On July 4th, a UFO disappears off radar scope.

00;02;41;14 - 00;03;07;04
Unknown
This is likely the crash date the following day, July 5th. The area of North Roswell is quarantined. Guards were stationed north of town on highway 285, blocking roads. This same day, debris and bodies were shipped out of Roswell hangar 84 to either Right Pad or Fort Worth, Texas. The following day, rancher Mac Brazel takes a box of debris into his local sheriff's office.

00;03;07;07 - 00;03;36;06
Unknown
Brazel had discovered a wreckage field on Foster Ranch, 75 miles north of Roswell. Intelligence Officer Jesse Marcel, senior was dispatched to observe and recover the wreckage, and it is crucial to note here the existence of two separate locations from Roswell. This is always a misconception. I see the debris field discovered by Brazel and investigated by Marcel, was not the location where the craft and bodies were allegedly recovered.

00;03;36;08 - 00;04;06;25
Unknown
The debris field was 3.4 miles long and 300ft wide and consisted solely of craft ejecta, strange metallic material was discovered that was almost massless, yet retained shape and showed resistance to blunt and sheer trauma. I highly recommend my Battelle video as this wreckage was likely studied by Battelle Memorial Institute. The second location, just north of Roswell, was kept far more under wraps, and there's far more secrecy around this location.

00;04;06;27 - 00;04;38;13
Unknown
Anyways, Marcel loaded wreckage onto a military jeep, and on the way home to the Roswell Army Airfield, showed his family pieces of the wreckage, including his son, Jesse Marcel Jr. On July 8th, in a press conference mandated by Colonel William Blanchard and confirmed by the 509th bomb Group, public relations Officer, Lieutenant Walter Hot, the RAAF revealed a flying disc crashed and was in Air Force possession the same day.

00;04;38;14 - 00;05;12;27
Unknown
Headlines were made stating RAAF captures flying saucer on ranch in Roswell region. That same day, the Roswell story is killed. General Roger Ramey ordered a retraction to the Saucer News, shifting the story to a recovered weather balloon. Marcel was photographed in Ramis office with aluminum foil, not recovered material for press purposes. Marcel himself later admitted to this in a 1978 interview with the legendary Stanton Freeman, where he revealed he was ordered to participate in a cover up.

00;05;13;00 - 00;05;40;15
Unknown
Marcel ordered his family not to talk about the wreckage. Blanchard goes on leave. Brazel disappears and Marcel moves to Fort Worth. Nobody could be contacted about the events in the story is killed for decades, so where does Lieutenant Walter Hot of the 509th bomb Group, fit into this as a whistleblower? Well, first, let's start with his credentials. During World War Two, hot was a bombardier who flew 35 missions in Japan.

00;05;40;18 - 00;06;07;12
Unknown
He participated in A-bomb testing in bikini, Italy, and served in the 509 atomic bomb Group at Roswell Army Airfield. At the time of the alleged crash in 1947, an interesting fact his group, the 509th, was the Air Force wing that dropped the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki four years after the event, and Jesse Marcel's admitted cover up in 1978, hot stayed silent.

00;06;07;15 - 00;06;39;25
Unknown
It wasn't until the early 90s he began speaking up. On May 14th, 1993, hot wrote and signed an official affidavit discussing his experience at Roswell. He wanted to put it into a press release. When the Colonel tells the first Lieutenant almost verbatim, what he wants in a press release, and guess what? He yet. You don't argue with them and say, oh, I think it'd sound better if we said it this way or the next way.

00;06;39;27 - 00;07;16;14
Unknown
The answer to all was yes, sir. So what exactly did the press release say? In essence, it was very simple to the effect that we had in our possession a flying saucer. It was found on a ranch up north of Roswell. It was being flown to General Raimi's office. Here, hot discusses how Colonel Blanchard, the base commander, called Walter at RAAF to say he had in his possession a flying saucer or parts from a disc.

00;07;16;16 - 00;07;50;16
Unknown
He stated these pieces came from a ranch northwest of Roswell. An intelligence officer, Jesse Marcel, would fly the materials to Fort Worth. Information that I got was. Given to me almost verbatim by Colonel Blanchard. And he'd written off of a scratch pad that he had in front of them. What he was saying to me, and I was writing it down, and after we got all through that, I kind of odd.

00;07;50;19 - 00;08;19;24
Unknown
And he said, I want you to give it to the local newspapers and radio stations and do it posthaste. And all he got in reply was a yes, sir, and away I went. I meant that they put all the hunks and pieces in a I think it was at that time A0C 54 aircraft that they loaded up primarily with, the material.

00;08;19;26 - 00;08;53;15
Unknown
And that airplane was flown. The material was not flown. So hot says that material were loaded into aircraft. The aircraft took off, but the material did not. Also, Blanchard ordered not to write a news release about the operation to be delivered to two radio stations in Roswell. And both of the newspapers, the Daily Record and The Dispatch newspaper's heart, was stunned by the following retraction and changing of the story to a weather balloon by general Roger Ramey, and believe there was no chance.

00;08;53;17 - 00;09;26;15
Unknown
Neither Blanchard nor Marcel mistook the wreckage for a weather balloon. Marcel even admitted his involvement, like I stated earlier, and he also did privately to Walter in 1980. Interestingly enough, we can look at the signed affidavit made by Arthur McQuarrie, the managing editor of the Roswell Morning Dispatch at the time of the incident. McQueary here confirms the delivery of the press release by Hot and the subsequent call made from the RAAF, saying the release was incorrect and the wreckage was that of a recovered balloon.

00;09;26;17 - 00;09;47;26
Unknown
McQueary was also good friends with Colonel Blanford, and months after the event, the colonel told the editor, quote, I will tell you this and nothing more. The stuff I saw, I've never seen any place else in my life. Oh, and by the way, we do have even more legal affidavits here, such as from Fort Worth Army Airfield. Colonel Thomas J.

00;09;47;26 - 00;10;16;15
Unknown
DuBose, who confirmed the material shown with Jesse Marcel in Remy's office, was indeed a weather balloon used as a cover story. In addition to this, he states he was in charge of arranging the requested materials be sent from RAAF to Fort Worth, which were then sent on to general law at Wright Field. Shockingly, this is not the only affidavit signed and written by hot, meaning maybe he didn't tell all of his story here in the early 90s.

00;10;16;18 - 00;10;43;06
Unknown
In 2002, Haut completed another legal document to be released two years after his death. After his passing in 2005, 2007 saw the release of Hot's final statements. Here, hot expands on his firsthand encounters with the Roswell incident. On the morning of July 8th, Walter attended the staff meeting with Colonel Blatchford, General Ramey, and Chief of Staff Colonel DuBose, among others.

00;10;43;09 - 00;11;13;16
Unknown
The topic of this discussion was the freshly discovered debris field, found 75 miles northwest of Roswell, and the primary site 40 miles north of town. Samples of wreckage were passed around the meeting, and here, hot once again confirms the lightweight metallic alloy with shape retention abilities, this time featuring some strange markings. These markings were actually discussed by Marcel Senior and his son, who saw the wreckage his father brought home, Jesse Marcel Jr.

00;11;13;18 - 00;11;46;05
Unknown
The team did not know whether or not to go public with the findings. General Ramey proposed a plan to divert attention away from the more important site just north of town. The craft site. By drawing much more attention to the debris field at 9:30 a.m., Lansford dictated the press release about a flying disc too hot before leaving the base, Blanchfield took the five or ninth lieutenant to building 84, a B-29 hangar that was under heavy guard control on both the interior and exterior.

00;11;46;07 - 00;12;13;11
Unknown
Once inside, hot was allowed to view what had been recovered just north of town. He observed an egg shaped craft 12 to 15ft in length and six feet in diameter, with a metallic surface. The craft had no windows, portholes, wings, landing gear or tail section, and this description reminds me very closely of the craft as described by Aero whistleblower Eric Tabor, that was stored in area 51.

00;12;13;14 - 00;12;36;21
Unknown
Additionally, the lieutenant saw a couple bodies under a canvas tarp. Only the heads were visible and Walter could make out no features due to the poor lining, but the bodies were the size of a ten year old child, roughly four feet high, with larger than normal heads. A temporary morgue here was set up, and in another video I will cover the sworn statements of this Roswell mortician.

00;12;36;23 - 00;13;04;15
Unknown
And finally, hot reiterates what was told to him by Marcel that the officer took pieces of the wreckage to General Ramsey's office, and, upon returning from a map room, discovering balsa wood and foil from a weather balloon and radar kite. Why Walter never revealed this story earlier. Well, he said he swore to Blanchard he would never reveal what he saw in his lifetime.

00;13;04;18 - 00;13;33;21
Unknown
And now we get on to another former USG military personnel, Brigadier General Steven Lumpkin, who appeared on Steven Greer's 2001 disclosure Project. Now, don't be swooning over the title Brigadier General just yet, folks. Lufkin was a, quote unquote, brigadier general in the North Carolina State Guard, a volunteer militia with no official military standing. So Greer embellished Lumpkin credentials or didn't vet this through enough.

00;13;33;22 - 00;14;10;27
Unknown
However, Lufkin did enter the Army in 1958 and joined the Pentagon's radio frequency engineering office. Stephen then went on to the white House Army, signaling Agency in 1959. As a technical specialist, Lufkin served in both the Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations, with an above top secret clearance. Also from multiple independent sources, including the esteemed ufologist Joe McGuire. Lufkin was also an attendee to the 1998 briefing with Doctor Greer, Doctor Mitchell, Rear Admiral Thomas Wilson, commander Will Miller, and others.

00;14;10;29 - 00;14;31;17
Unknown
This meeting featured in the Wilson Davis Memo, was confirmed by Wilson himself to be true. If you don't know about the memo, this was the first video I ever made and what I consider to be one of the most important documents of all time. Link to this video will be in the description. So let's start to look at and analyze some of love Ken's claims.

00;14;31;20 - 00;14;58;11
Unknown
I learned a lot about Project Blue Book. Blue Book was discussed quite openly in the office. Sections of Blue Book were open for discussion. And then there were other matters as well that that were brought to, our attention one afternoon when love Ken's work at the white House Army Signaling Agency dealt with codebreaking. In the process, he learned much about the ongoing Blue Book.

00;14;58;14 - 00;15;19;08
Unknown
He states, quote, the findings that were put in there were highly scientific. They were highly gone over by the people that knew what they wanted to put in there. This information was information that would never get out to anyone else, but it was designed for the use of particular military personnel. What was there was extremely exact and scientific.

00;15;19;10 - 00;15;45;08
Unknown
You saw an awful lot. You saw a lot of pictures. Most of the pictures we have seen duplicates of today. Some were the pictures that I saw where I think, maybe, a little bit better. They were taken by, Air Force pilots as well because of, the UFOs. Yes. They actually had pictures of UFOs.

00;15;45;11 - 00;16;10;21
Unknown
Oh, indeed they did. Yes. Not only the Air Force, but but, some were taken by civilian pilots. Some were taken by, Marine Air Corp, pilots. And some were foreign quote. I would say there were probably between 2 and 300 cases of lock on. And that's why those cases were in there because they were authentic and quote.

00;16;10;24 - 00;16;33;03
Unknown
Interesting to me is how all of this particular language for particular personnel, never seemed to make it into the official declassified Project Bluebook reports. Equally as interesting are the alleged photos that, along with numerous cases, were omitted from Blue Book. The lock on statement is additionally accurate. If you remember from my video on the history of the UFO stigma.

00;16;33;05 - 00;17;05;18
Unknown
Major Héctor Quintanilla lied to Congress that Bluebook uncovered zero radar lock on cases. Unfortunately, this statement was later on corrected by the infamous J.L. and Hynek, who supplied multiple such radar identification cases. And what gives Luckin some more credibility to me is his mention of the Air Force when discussing Bluebook. He states, quote, the Air Force at that time was very, very much concerned with Bluebook, and there were strict regulations involving anything that had to do with reporting of UFOs or talking about a UFO.

00;17;05;21 - 00;17;26;15
Unknown
If you wanted to ruin your career, it was explained to us. The thing that would do this fastest was to talk about UFOs and quote, as someone who talks every video now about use, I've read 202. I find it admirable and interesting. Love can makes this connection. I know what you're thinking guys. Gerb we all know Bluebook was a front.

00;17;26;16 - 00;17;53;29
Unknown
You talk about it in every single video you make. Everyone knows that scientific evidence was compartmented outside of Bluebook. Is this all love can has to offer? Well, there's a reason I put Love Can Hear in the same video with Walter Hot during a meeting discussing Bluebook materials, love can claimed one Colonel Halibut, which may be a Greer misspelling of hollow gard or hollow burg, brought out a metallic piece similar to a yardstick.

00;17;54;01 - 00;18;19;23
Unknown
The metal had encryption on it, described by halberd as symbols of instruction so important they can keep the military working on them at a consistent basis. They went on to further explain that that this was the material that had come from, the New Mexico crash in 1947. Well, he said it had been taken from one of the craft that had, crashed.

00;18;19;23 - 00;18;44;28
Unknown
And, in New Mexico, and that had been taken from a box of materials that the military was working on. They didn't use the word reverse engineering at that time, but there was something similar to the reverse engineering. Anybody who knows the Roswell story and now the whistleblower, Walter Hot, knows the infamous encrypted, quote, IBM.

00;18;45;01 - 00;19;09;22
Unknown
The piece Jesse Marcel senior showed his son. This famous material from the alleged crash has actually been claimed to have been viewed by many people. And I encourage you to take a dive in. The video description will be a link to all witness accounts. But that's not all Lufkin had to say about Roswell. He even comments on one of the most fascinating yet contentious aspects of the case bodies.

00;19;09;24 - 00;19;44;03
Unknown
And the next day it was discussed again. They did discuss the fact that there were bodies, actually extraterrestrial bodies. Yes. There were either 3 or 5 and and they didn't even know at that point, because some of the, some of the information that they had gotten apparently was, was incomplete, but 3 or 5 stands out in my mind as, as a number that, that were taken, they were one was alive, partially alive at the time that this happened.

00;19;44;06 - 00;20;13;07
Unknown
Our military organization today bears little relation to that known of any of my predecessors in peacetime, or indeed, by the fighting men of World War Two or Korea. In 1961, President Dwight Eisenhower gave the forever famous speech warning about the dangers of the military industrial complex. I, and I'm sure many other UFO researchers, have wondered if he was partly referring to the legacy UFO programs here.

00;20;13;10 - 00;20;43;16
Unknown
The program Grush speaks of that Admiral Wilson almost uncovered the program that has been attempting to reverse engineer and recover a UFO since at least Roswell in 1947. Eisenhower's connections to UFO lore are legendary. After all, the alleged MG 12 documents state, the shadowy group reported to Truman and Eisenhower. And we cannot forget the astonishing story of Eisenhower meeting with a group of extraterrestrials after their landing at Holloman Air Force Base in 1954.

00;20;43;19 - 00;21;11;07
Unknown
The story goes, Eisenhower made an agreement with these beings. I've yet to dive too much into this alleged encounter between a president and extraterrestrials, but was this what crush was referring to when he said deals had been made with an eye? And it's quite clear that you're talking about agreements between America and non-human intelligences. Have we made agreements with non-human intelligences?

00;21;11;10 - 00;21;38;12
Unknown
That's the kind of information I really hope national leadership is able to get to the bottom of. I need to pin you down on this. Are the agreements between non-human intelligence sources and the American government? I think that's a question that I would like to know all the details of as well. There are more sobering stories of Eisenhower being read into the current estimates of the UFO phenomenon during his presidency, but losing control.

00;21;38;14 - 00;22;03;04
Unknown
This is the estimated time where the program broke free of government and congressional oversight, and this seems to be the stance that love can takes. And he can offer some valuable context here. So I'm going to let this short clip play in its entirety. The whole process of dealing with with, with the UFO phenomenon, could not be handled any more by one agency.

00;22;03;04 - 00;22;28;00
Unknown
And so in order to keep it alive, and I guess as cheaply as possible, it was it was given to various and sundry parts of the government to work on. And I guess they thought that they could they could also keep the intelligence. Factor as, secret as possible by, by giving little Asian agencies a little bit here and a little bit there.

00;22;28;02 - 00;22;55;08
Unknown
And that oftentimes is done with, with matters like this. But but what happened was Eisenhower got sold out, the without him knowing it, he lost control of, of of what was going on with, with the entire, I think with the entire UFO situation. But I think he was telling us the military industrial complex will stick you in the back.

00;22;55;11 - 00;23;28;18
Unknown
If, if you are not totally vigilant and, I think he felt like he had not been vigilant. I think he felt like he trusted too many people. And, and Eisenhower was a trusting man. He was a good man. And I think, I think that he realized that all of a sudden, this this, this matter is, is going into, into the control of corporations, that, that could very well be, used, in, in detriment to this country.

00;23;28;18 - 00;23;55;22
Unknown
I think the frustration from what I can remember went on for months. He, he, realized that he was losing control. He realized that this this the phenomenon of of, of whatever it was that, that we were faced with, was not going to be in the best hands and that that those were the as far as I can remember, that was the expression that was used.

00;23;55;24 - 00;24;23;21
Unknown
It's not going to be in the best hands. In a separate interview with author Grant Cameron, Lufkin stated he attended Camp David with Eisenhower and other staff on multiple occasions. Although just a sergeant at the time, Stephan noted the good nature of Eisenhower, who made sure to know the name of each and every person. One night, Lufkin overheard the president, on a telephone call, begin to discuss the 1952 UFOs over Washington, DC incident.

00;24;23;23 - 00;24;51;25
Unknown
Apparently, this wasn't a rare occasion, as UFOs were, quote, a very, very important concern of his. And quote, Eisenhower was additionally concerned about losing control over the military industrial complex. Lufkin states. The president began being kept out of information regarding UAP later in his term. In his disclosure Project interview, Lufkin also comments on UFOs being a career killer to speak about openly, and this is just the tip of the iceberg.

00;24;51;28 - 00;25;34;04
Unknown
An older officer involved with the CIA in Dia told him uncovering revelations about the phenomenon could lead to somebody being erased. He said those threats have been made and carried out, he said. Those threats started, way back in 1947. The Army was given, the Air Force, excuse me, was given the, absolute control over how to handle this, this being the biggest, the biggest security situation that, that this country has ever dealt with.

00;25;34;06 - 00;25;59;03
Unknown
I guess fear has done it. I don't care what kind of a person you are, okay? How strong or courageous you are. It would be a very fearful situation because from what Matt said, he said they, he said they'll go after not only you. He said they'll go after your family. Those were his words. Have people been killed to protect the secret?

00;25;59;05 - 00;26;22;26
Unknown
Based on the people I talked to, that was an ongoing, concern. Yeah. Unfortunately, I've heard some really un-American things I don't want to repeat right now. So you have a strong suspicion that people have been murdered to protect this over the years? Yeah. Hey, guys. Thank you so much for joining me today as I start this new series diving into UFO whistleblowers and their claims.

00;26;22;29 - 00;26;43;05
Unknown
Let me get something out of the way. I'm sorry for the disheveled appearance. Yesterday, May 4th, I tested for my purple belt in Brazilian jiu jitsu. And, along the way, I took some injuries, including a pretty nasty eye poke, so I'm just thankful I can see out of this eye. But I was really inspired to cover these two men, Walter Hot and Stephen Lufkin.

00;26;43;05 - 00;27;00;21
Unknown
Stephen, Stephen, I know I probably got it wrong, so I'm sorry. Let me have it in the comments. So I know I'm mispronounced things every single video, but I wanted to cover these two men due to the relevancy of their claims. I. I stay away from stating my personal opinion most of the time until the end of the video, such as here.

00;27;00;21 - 00;27;32;11
Unknown
But, I personally do believe that in 1947, Roswell, New Mexico, some sort of non-human intelligence craft crashed. I think this is the nexus of reverse engineering programs, possibly magenta, Italy earlier, but maybe the program wasn't so condensed and compartmentalized and efficient then. But I think Roswell is one of the largest incidents in UFO history. And I think it is one of the best whistleblowers and people to discuss his experience with this, with Blanchard, with General Ramey.

Because as everybody knows, General Ramey, the man who needed to kill the Roswell story, is also the same general who gave the press release with General Samford in 1952, following the UFOs over Washington, DC. So just a relevant whistleblower, relevant case to talk about. So you can tell by the shirt, very passionate about Roswell and Stephen Lufkin.

Not only does he talk more about Roswell, but I think he has a lot of keen insights to offer about kind of where this program started to spiral out, this legacy program he talks about and some of the crimes they've committed, including murder and not just attacking people, but attacking their family as well. I think it's pretty probable that around the 1960s, with Dwight Eisenhower, private corporations and and parts of the legacy program being in the private sector and funded through private corporations, and I really started to break away in the 60s.

I believe this is when congressional and presidential oversight were lost with the program. So I personally find love can quite credible. The biggest stain here, of course, is the brigadier general thing for a volunteer militia. I really wish Steven Greer wouldn't have included that in the video because even the slightest bit of research, you can kind of, tell that that's a little bit of an embellishment.

So that's definitely a little bit of a credibility stain on his case. But I thought these two whistleblowers were the perfect two people to kind of get our feet wet and get started. In the future, we will have whistleblowers, crash retrieval whistleblowers, reverse engineering whistleblowers. Just citing whistleblowers, radar whistleblowers, all types of whistleblowers. You can imagine now that I could make a 20 part series on this with 2 or 3 people.
