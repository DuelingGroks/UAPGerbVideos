Unknown
In 1950, Canadian government senior radio engineer Wilbert B Smith wrote to the Controller of Telecommunications in the Department of Transport requesting for Canada to begin its first official investigation into UFOs, specifically studying complex magnetism as a form of propulsion. In this letter, Smith makes four astounding claims told to him by a source within Washington regarding UFOs. One. The matter is the most highly classified subject in the United States government, rating even higher than the H-bomb.

00;00;36;19 - 00;01;05;06
Unknown
Two flying saucers exist. Three. Their modus operandi is unknown, but concentrated effort is being made by a small group headed by Doctor Vannevar Bush and four. The entire matter is considered by the United States authorities to be of tremendous significance. That very same year, Canada actually began its first official investigation into UAP Project Magnet. But this isn't our topic for today.

00;01;05;07 - 00;01;32;20
Unknown
In fact, I want to dive into the curious connections of Wilbert B Smith's source one doctor Robert. I saw Barker. Hey, guys, it's UAP Group. Thank you so much for joining me today. Let's investigate the astonishing claims and connections of one doctor, Robert Sah Barker. Physicist, student of Einstein and consultant to the DoD Research and Development Board in the 1950s under the Truman administration.

00;01;32;22 - 00;01;48;15
Unknown
Sara Barker may just have the keys and knowledge to help us understand the early days of the USGS feverish obsession with UFOs and crash retrieval efforts.

00;01;48;17 - 00;02;15;08
Unknown
Quickly, who was Doctor Robert SAR Barker? SAR Barker was an esteemed physicist and student of Albert Einstein that graduated from Harvard. He served as the founder and dean of the Washington Institute of Technology, scientific consultant to the US Marines and as mentioned earlier, involved in the Joint Research and Development Board. His research was specifically remote controlling rockets close to the doctor's passing.

00;02;15;08 - 00;02;42;00
Unknown
In 1987, researcher Adam Duncan located SAR. Barker's son, Robert Jr junior, said his father spoke sparingly about the UFO phenomenon, but the youth would occasionally question his father. In Junior's words, quote, he knew that they were real for the obvious reason that they would be going 600mph and then make a 90 degree turn in mid-air without slowing down, separated from all the inertia and gravity.

00;02;42;02 - 00;02;59;09
Unknown
Dad said that the reason he was called in to build the right kind of missile to track these things, since they were way too fast for any of our planes to catch. They wanted the missile to not destroy any of the UFOs, but to be able to track them. So dad had cameras installed, like on the V2 rockets.

00;02;59;11 - 00;03;12;03
Unknown
So when the UFO comes into our space, he would shoot missiles at them with cameras on them. Since only a missile could keep up with the speed turns.

00;03;12;05 - 00;03;37;15
Unknown
As we know with Lieutenant Robert Jacobs in the UFO disabling a dummy nuclear warhead, UFOs do have an interest in ballistic missiles. So is there any way we confirm Saab's claims about the V2 rocket to begin to lend him some credibility? In fact, we can look directly to 1949 Project Twinkl, a project tasked with observing UFO, specifically green fireballs alongside Project Grudge.

00;03;37;18 - 00;04;04;27
Unknown
On page 33 of the report, we could find an incident from August 31st, 1950, where the phenomenon was observed after a V2 rocket launch. Following this, sightings plan were set in place from Holloman Air Force Base to attempt to pursue the objects and get photos at close range, and we can head over to the White Sands Missile Range in the 1940s, where we can take a look at the experience of Master Sergeant Lloyd Eugene Camp, a radar operator at the Missile Range.

00;04;05;00 - 00;04;33;10
Unknown
Camp performed high level research on the captured German V2 rockets, according to camp, and this is documented in the following report. That has been pretty torn up. Once a V2 was launched and two UFOs appeared alongside the missile, camp observed the craft via both visual and radar confirmation. He observed two silver discs circling the rocket for several minutes before the UFOs turned on their sides and accelerated away at an astonishing rate.

00;04;33;12 - 00;05;02;15
Unknown
And according to camp's daughter, her father had seen similar events several times. We could also look at some claims made by former US New Mexico State Rep J. Andrew Kisner. But all I wanted to do here was prove that while we can't definitively link Saab Walker's research to photographing UFOs from V2, we can see multiple instances where V2 rockets and UFOs intersect.

00;05;02;17 - 00;05;49;24
Unknown
The matter is the most highly classified subject in the US government, rating higher even than the H-bomb flying saucers exist. Their modus operandi is unknown, but concentrated effort is being made by a small group headed by Doctor Vannevar Bush, and the entire matter is considered by the US state authorities to be of tremendous significance. These are incredibly bold claims for Wilbert to relay from a source within Washington to the Canadian government, which directly led to the formation of Canada's two official UFO investigations Project Magnet, which studied the possibility of reverse engineering UFO magnetic propulsion concepts to exploit Earth's magnetic field as a propulsion source and project second story, which sought to recommend UFO action to

00;05;49;24 - 00;06;14;07
Unknown
the Canadian government. In fact, Canada has always seemed to be close on the heels of US UFO research. Like in 2023, when Canadian Parliament member Larry Maguire wrote to the Canadian Minister of Defense to discuss research and development of recovered UAP material in conjunction with retrieval operations of the Five Eyes Nations. Wilbur. Its source of these statements was Robert Saab Hawker.

00;06;14;14 - 00;06;42;00
Unknown
But how do we know that? Well, besides a direct confirmation in 1983 from Savarkar himself, which I will touch on soon, historian Arthur Bray uncovered both the 1950 Department of Transport memo and Smith's meeting notes with Robert Saab Hawker in the late engineer's estate. The following handwriting is horrendous, and the following is a transcription of Wilbert Smith's meeting with Doctor Robert that led to the 1950s memo.

00;06;42;02 - 00;07;03;12
Unknown
I'm not going to spend time reading through the entire conversation, but there are a couple things I'd like to comment on in the memo, specifically the mention of Frank Scully and Doctor Vannevar Bush. Wilbert mentions that he has read the book Behind the Flying Saucers, released by Frank Scully in 1950, which saw Bowker claims the contents of the book are fundamentally correct.

00;07;03;14 - 00;07;30;02
Unknown
And it's worth noting Scully publicized the now contentious and famous alleged 1949 Aztec, New Mexico crash and discusses the case at length within the book. Now, guys, I have my reservations about this case, and I'm saving judgment until I sit down and discuss more with a trusted friend who has tirelessly investigated Aztec. But it is worth noting this book framed a straightforward interpretation of flying saucers.

00;07;30;05 - 00;07;56;25
Unknown
Scully does discuss some pretty controversial information here, but the book is a fantastic read, and of course, I'll list it in the show notes SA Baker told Wilbert the study of UFOs in the United States government was done by a small group spearheaded by Doctor Vannevar Bush, who was at this time the chairman of the Research and Development Board, to which Chas Baker belonged, and the chairman for the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, which would later become NASA.

00;07;56;27 - 00;08;26;21
Unknown
Vannevar seems to be steeped in UFO lore. In fact, the origin of the infamous MJ 12 documents can be traced back to Vannevar Bush, his creation of the Joint Research and Development Board, established in 1941, which consisted of, you guessed it, 12 members. I don't necessarily want to get into this can of worms. That is the majestic 12 right now, seen as this heap of documents whose contents seem to be a mishmash of forged documents with some possibly real documents or data spliced in.

00;08;26;23 - 00;08;44;21
Unknown
However, I do promise that one day I will cover these. The documents specifically quote briefing document Operation Majestic 12 specifically states Doctor Bush was a member of the team tasked by Truman to investigate crashed UAP.

00;08;44;23 - 00;09;10;19
Unknown
In 1983, UFO researcher William Steinman wrote to Doctor Star Baker wishing to discuss UFOs. In November of 83, SAR Baker replied with a truly startling letter. In his response, the doctor responded to a series of 12 questions prompted by William, the Doctor outright states he had no association with any of the people involved in recoveries, nor did he know of the dates of UFO crash recoveries.

00;09;10;21 - 00;09;36;25
Unknown
SA Baker was, however, invited to participate in several discussions regarding recoveries on the R&D board, but was not given access to personally attend. But he did restate that Vannevar Bush was definitely involved alongside John von Neumann and Doctor J. Robert Oppenheimer. Doctor SA Baker did not receive any photographs of UFOs, but did in fact view official reports whilst in his Pentagon office.

00;09;36;27 - 00;10;02;02
Unknown
In a direct quote from Star Baker, quote about the only thing I remember at this time is that certain materials reported to have come from flying saucer crashes were extremely light and very tough. I am sure our laboratories analyze them very carefully. There were reports that instruments or people operating these machines were also very light weight, sufficient to withstand the tremendous deceleration and acceleration.

00;10;02;02 - 00;10;27;15
Unknown
Associate with their machinery. I remember in talking with some of the people at the office that I got the impression these quote unquote aliens were constructed like certain insects. We have observed on Earth, wherein because of the low mass, the inertial forces involved in operation of these instruments would be quite low. I still do not know why the high order of classification has been given, and why the denial of the existence of these devices.

00;10;27;18 - 00;10;51;25
Unknown
I am willing to bet, and I'm sure I'm not the only one thinking this, but the discussion of very lightweight and tough materials immediately draws my mind to the Roswell crash. What lends even more credence to this is the study of lightweight sheet metal alloys, as conducted by Battelle in 1949. If you have not watched that video, I highly suggest giving you the view as there I directly correlate recovered wreckage from Roswell to the secret.

00;10;51;25 - 00;11;18;25
Unknown
Battelle contracted work on nitinol. I got the impression these aliens were constructed like certain insects we've observed on Earth, and quote. This stands out to me almost more than anything else. Interesting to use the word alien in quotations, as if the doctor isn't ready to finalize this new origin, especially now in 2024, where many of us view the phenomenon as likely more than just an extraterrestrial origin.

00;11;18;27 - 00;11;27;01
Unknown
But the insectoid description is unsettling and bizarre.

00;11;27;03 - 00;11;53;28
Unknown
In that same year of 1983, legendary UFO researcher Stanton Friedman learned of the 1950 Wilbert Smith memo and tracked down SAR Barker. The following conversation will play on screen, however, I'll be covering what stands out to me. After some pleasantries, the two quickly begin talking about UFOs. SAR Barker touches back to the insectoid beings, discussing a meeting at Wright Field about a crash where, quote.

00;11;54;00 - 00;12;21;07
Unknown
But later on, one of the fellows said to me that those guys, if they were people, were made like insects. They didn't have any skin on their bodies. So they were saying that's how they were able to accelerate and decelerate without being torn apart and quote. So these beings recovered, presumably Roswell, with even greater confidence. Now that Wright Field and the crash occurring out west has been mentioned, seemingly had inertial dampening capabilities built into their bodies.

00;12;21;09 - 00;12;45;21
Unknown
When pressed for why SAR Baker told Smith the UFO subject was classified even higher than the H-bomb. The doctor alludes to several crash recoveries Friedman presses to see if the crash Star Baker is referring to occurred in 1947 as presumably, Oppenheimer would have been involved. SAR Baker responds very likely, and here we get to the most important part of this conversation.

00;12;45;24 - 00;13;09;17
Unknown
Stanton asked who attended this meeting. That right field, sir Baker states, quote, I remember there was one guy. Frankly, I didn't like him very much. He, he had some company, as I had seemed to me. He was from Philadelphia and he was going to all the meetings and acting very smug about it. This would later be revealed to be Doctor Eric, a Walker, who I will talk about shortly.

00;13;09;20 - 00;13;39;24
Unknown
Later on in the conversation, the two talk about the deep interest in UAP flight characteristics occurring in the 1950s. Walker and the R&D board were fascinated by the objects that flew at great speeds and information. I'm thinking this might be a reference to the 1951 Lubbock's Lights case. At the time, the DoD board was perplexed at how they worked, what they were made of, how they could go so fast and how they could seemingly instantaneously accelerate.

00;13;39;26 - 00;13;58;25
Unknown
Sorry. Baker had assumed at this time a manipulation of gravity would unlock the doors behind UFO flight characteristics. We can skip the rest of this conversation, as it covers the doctor's business ventures and setting up of the Washington Institute of Technology.

00;13;58;28 - 00;14;32;03
Unknown
As uncovered in The Friedman Call, Doctor Eric A Walker was listed as one of the right field members discussing crash retrievals. And now we get into a very interesting figure named by Robert Sorry, Baker. Before we dive into the many connections with Eric in UFOs, who was Doctor Walker? Walker was the former president of Penn State University from 56 to 71, a member of many defense boards, including the chairman for the Institute for Defense Analysis and the Executive secretary of the Defense Research Board from 50 to 51.

00;14;32;05 - 00;14;57;23
Unknown
So this is a very serious and accredited man. His biography is far more detailed and fascinating, so I do recommend checking that out in the video description. After his name became publicly known by Friedman, Walker was approached by a number of researchers, including William Steinman and Habib Henry Assad. The hell pseudonym for almond. Victorian began questioning Eric about his involvement in the phenomenon.

00;14;57;26 - 00;15;20;09
Unknown
I will cover these all more in a little detail, but directly, according to Walker, he was involved in the 1965 Kecksburg Pennsylvania crash, confirmed the existence of the majestic 12, or a similar group discussed that contact had been made with Nye, and that reverse engineering efforts were a waste of time due to the technology being far beyond human understanding.

00;15;20;11 - 00;15;56;26
Unknown
Walker's first interview was conducted with William Steinman, kicking off the investigation mentioned above. In this interview, Walker directly confirms he attended the meeting around 1949 1950, as described by Saab Walker, concerning military crash and body retrieval efforts. Walker tells William he will attempt to find and contemplate sharing his notes on the right Pat meeting. Since this interview took place mere weeks after Friedman made the MJ 12 documents public, of course, Steinman inquires about the legitimacy of the majestic 12 quote yes, I know of MJ 12.

00;15;56;29 - 00;16;32;03
Unknown
I have known of them for 40 years. I believe that you're chasing after and fighting with windmills, end quote. Curiously, Walker recommends Steinman drop the subject because he is, quote, delving into an area that you can do absolutely nothing about. In 1990, Walker conducted a series of three recorded calls with Doctor Henry Victorian. In these interviews, the two discuss some fascinating topics, such as the 1978 Bolivia UFO crash, which I covered in my Moondust video, and the possibility of insect like bodies being recovered.

00;16;32;05 - 00;17;01;18
Unknown
In the second interview, Walker outright asserts while the MJ 12 exists, the documents are likely forgeries. Doctor Eric tells Victorian quote, couple people are capable of handling this issue unless your mind ability is like Einstein's or likewise, I do not think you can achieve anything. End quote. What is fascinating in this second interview is the cryptic tone Walker takes when asked about his involvement in studying UFO as, quote, how good is your sixth sense?

00;17;01;18 - 00;17;30;09
Unknown
How much do you know about ESP? Unless you know about it and how to use it, you would not be taken in. Only a few know about it and quote. The third interview covers more of the same topics, but with Walker talking even more cryptically. However, Walker also confirms Bush's involvement within the program. Around 1991, investigation into Walker showed him to be positioned as Penn State president around 100 miles near Kecksburg, Pennsylvania.

00;17;30;12 - 00;17;59;21
Unknown
In this town, a small bell shaped almost like an acorn UFO allegedly crashed in 1965. This case is fascinating, and I'll cover it in more detail in the future as it warrants its own full analysis. But in short, Walker directly confirms, quote, we went there with two from the military, but not on duty, end quote. And this is of course in reference to the UFO crash site.

00;17;59;24 - 00;18;25;20
Unknown
From Star Baker and Doctor Eric Walker, we have discussed so much of crash retrievals and some sort of significant meeting that occurred in 1950 at Wright Field that served to discuss UFO crash operations. Well, interestingly enough, we do have a relevant document to analyze from this same year, the Hoddle Memo on March 22nd, 1950, FBI CIA agent Guy Hoddle wrote to FBI director J.

00;18;25;20 - 00;18;52;06
Unknown
Edgar Hoover, relaying information from an Air Force investigator my guess is etic or the Air Force Tactical Intelligence Center. Remember back to my Battelle investigation. In 1952, Atic commissioned Battelle for Project Stork, a parallel project to bluebook not known to the public to investigate UFOs and quote, assist the Air Force in reassuring the public that everything is well under control with respect to the UFO problem.

00;18;52;08 - 00;19;21;23
Unknown
Anyways, this investigator stated three flying saucers had been recovered in New Mexico. The craft were circular with raised centers and measured near 50ft in diameter. The craft were occupied by humanoid looking figures measuring three feet tall, dressed in metallic suits. According to one Mr. Carl. How the disks were found in New Mexico due to high powered radar and a likely cause of craft crashing, was due to this radar's interference with control mechanisms.

00;19;21;25 - 00;19;42;02
Unknown
Does this memo link with the retrieval discussion meeting? Both Star Baker and Walker stated to have taken place in 1950 at right field? And is this memo discussing the Roswell crash, which occurred three years prior to this memo? Hey guys, thank you so much for joining me today for this look into Robert SA Baker, his connections and his claims.

00;19;42;05 - 00;20;04;15
Unknown
Let me get things out of the way. I gotta say, I'm sorry in case things sounded weird during the video. Partway through filming, my brother came in town to visit and got me extremely ill. So if I sound off, it's due to the congestion. But no worries. I hope you found this dive into SA Baker interesting. I'm thinking back to Eric Walker and his interviews with William Steinman.

00;20;04;17 - 00;20;38;05
Unknown
And when Steinman brings up majestic 12. Because remember, around this time in the early 80s, all the buzz was going around about these majestic 12 documents because Stan Freeman had released these documents. Walker tells Steinman he is chasing and trying to fight windmills. I can't help but think back to the story of Don Quixote in this context. Is Walker basically telling Steinman him trying to investigate the MJ 12 docs he's chasing ghosts, fighting things that aren't there and looking in the wrong direction and fooling himself.

00;20;38;08 - 00;21;04;18
Unknown
It's interesting because in that same sentence, he says he knew about the MJ 12 documentary 40 Years. And throughout this video, with Walker and with Walker, we see the MJ 12 pop up numerous times. This is why I want to cover these documents so much, because while many of these documents are forgeries, like I said earlier in the video, there is some interesting aspects data or possibly even some documents in these that may be legitimate.

00;21;04;21 - 00;21;32;17
Unknown
I think when we look at this time period, the 50s, and even the early 60s, we only really think about Project Blue Book. Project grudge project signed Washington DC, 1952 UFOs incident. And we hardly ever try and analyze the kind of the program finding crash retrievals and reverse engineering. And I think we finally get a little bit of a look into that with Robert Saab Walker.

00;21;32;20 - 00;22;03;15
Unknown
I know investigating his case was super interesting because I knew about the 1950 Wilbert de Smith memo for a while, but let me know what you guys think. Do you think Saab's claims are accurate, especially about this meeting that occurred in 1949 to 1950 at Wright Field, about crash retrievals and reverse engineering efforts, that this gave him the confidence to outright tell Wilbert B Smith that the study of UFOs and flying saucers within the USG was classified, even higher than the H-bomb.

00;22;03;18 - 00;22;19;28
