David Grush. Robert Jacobs, David Fravor, Robert Sallis, Michael Herrera all UFO whistleblowers who have sworn their testimony before Congress. Testified to arrow or signed legal affidavits to swear in their statements. Phil Schneider, Clifford Stone, Don Phillips, Mr. Dennis. All UFO whistleblowers with astounding claims persisting throughout the decades, but with no real legal testimony or evidence to back them up.

00;00;27;20 - 00;00;55;01
Unknown
UFO whistleblowers have appeared throughout the decades, highlighting stories of incredible encounters, reverse engineering, crash retrievals, sinister USG elements hiding the UAP estimate whether these claims come with verifiable evidence, affidavits, sworn testimonies before Congress, or they reach our ears as little more than stories from a public or anonymous source. All UFO whistleblower testimonies deserve to be analyzed with a critical lens.

00;00;55;04 - 00;01;19;22
Unknown
Who knows what whistleblowers with sobering and real testimonies have been overlooked or buried in the annals of UFO lore. Who knows what whistleblowers may give us a peek behind the veil to get a glimpse at the shadowy program that has likely been operating since at least 1947. Hey guys, it's UAP verb! And join me today as I begin part two of my series studying UFO whistleblower throughout history.

00;01;19;24 - 00;01;42;25
Unknown
This series will bring to light lesser known whistleblowers I find worthy of discussing and studying. We will investigate the person making the claims and analyze the context of their claims, to see if we can start making heads or tails of the astonishing and perplexing stories of firsthand encounters with UAP.

00;01;42;27 - 00;02;09;18
Unknown
Harland F Bentley claimed to be involved with classified projects and several government agencies due to his electrical engineering degree, and graduate work in nuclear engineering. Bentley served as a private first class in the U.S. Army, where he was stationed at a Nike Ajax missile base just north of D.C., close to only Maryland as a radar operator. It was here he witnessed a UFO crash in May of 1958.

00;02;09;20 - 00;02;34;05
Unknown
Bentley first appeared on Greer's Disclosure Project in 2001, and while we don't have any affidavits like we did with Lufkin and Hot, I do find his claims worthy of investigation, and it is important to note I have not been able to verify any of Harlan's military education or contract records. So we have to analyze his story of a UFO crash and other astounding assertions on their own merit.

00;02;34;08 - 00;03;00;28
Unknown
In 1957 through 1959, Harland claimed to be stationed at a Nike Ajax missile facility just outside only Maryland. This leaves us with two possible sites. Site 192 of Gaithersburg, Maryland, nestled behind suburban complexes, and W 93 just north of Oni, which now serves as the Federal support center owned by FEMA. And quickly, what exactly is a Nike missile launch site?

00;03;00;29 - 00;03;27;28
Unknown
These facilities were utilized extensively during the Cold War, employing surface to air missile systems across the country and NATO to combat enemy bomber aircraft. The project Nike, spearheaded by Bell Labs, equipped the US Army to defend the American mainland and key sites from foreign aircraft raids. But back to Bentley. At 6 a.m. on May of 1958, Harland first heard a sound that was similar to a pulsating transformer.

00;03;28;01 - 00;03;38;25
Unknown
This reminds me closely to the sound Michael Herrera claimed to experience witnessing a human made craft. In 2009.

00;03;38;27 - 00;04;02;10
Unknown
Harland looked outside his window to a nearby civilian cornfield, roughly 2000 yards away, to observe a disc shaped object collide with the ground and immediately take off back into flight. Very unusual, as I have never heard of a UFO crash. With the craft regaining flight capabilities. Harland immediately got dressed and ran to the hill to observe the debris left by the craft.

00;04;02;10 - 00;04;26;22
Unknown
At a distance, one piece of metallic debris stuck out. In particular the size of a washing machine. This piece glowed white hot. Soon after, use of personnel arrived, utilizing long poles to harness the scattered pieces and place them on a lead lined truck. This is something we see pop up in many crash retrieval stories. These personnel arrived in radiation protection suits.

00;04;26;24 - 00;04;54;13
Unknown
Harland had no idea where the material would be taken. The craft described by Bentley is certainly perplexing. It measured roughly 30ft in diameter with saucer like, and had circular ball like lights on the outer rim and a structure on top similar to a cake. This is reminiscent of many classic described saucer configurations. The lights on the craft cycled between orange, red and white color and were described as pulsating.

00;04;54;16 - 00;05;20;08
Unknown
And one interesting thing I want to note here. Heartland states the saucer was quote, wobbling before it impacted the earth. This wobbling or gyration is something we often see in ufology, whether saucer or alternative shapes. One such recent example I covered is a 1950s Bluebook registered USO encounter, in which a cigar shaped object was seen hovering and wobbling above the ocean's surface.

00;05;20;10 - 00;05;42;09
Unknown
And one detail to note from the crash, when the craft took off again after colliding with the ground. The craft sheared off thick limbs of trees similar to the cutting of a sharp knife. This resembles closely the testimony of Corporal Jonathan Wiegand, who observed a UAP crash in Peru in 1997. Here, the craft sheer through local foliage and embedded itself within a chasm face.

00;05;42;12 - 00;06;13;22
Unknown
Quite shockingly, Harland claims this is the boring part of his experience. The exciting part occurred the next evening while on duty near 10 to 11 p.m., a nearby Gaithersburg facility phoned the Nike Ajax facility, stating they had 12 to 15 UFOs hovering 50 to 100ft off the ground in varying shapes. Some saucer, like. Harland, asked the radio operator what these craft sounded like, only to hear the same pulsating sound when the operator stuck his headset out the van window.

00;06;13;24 - 00;06;37;24
Unknown
Bentley's facility was able to view the blips on the M30 three radar sweep, where the other facility sat, only for all signatures to take off in one sweep. For reference, the M33 is a 33.33 rpm radar detection device for these objects to exit the center of the radar sweep, as calculated from an analog computer. They would have had to be traveling at excess of 17,000mph.

00;06;37;28 - 00;07;05;17
Unknown
This value is astounding, but let's all remember the father of German rocketry and mentor to Verner von Braun, Hermann Oberth, who gave a lecture on flying saucers in 1954 where he described recorded speeds of 19km per second or 42,000mph. Harland claims the presiding general debriefed the men, stating the signatures were in fact helicopters performing Navy, Army, Air Force maneuver training exercises.

00;07;05;19 - 00;07;33;06
Unknown
We have no supporting evidence or testimony in May of 1958 to support Bentley's claims. In fact, I can only find a tiny snippet from Baltimore's Evening Sun newspaper on December 23rd, 1958, which makes a passing mention to the US Air Force capturing at least two flying saucers. But we do have some very interesting contextual sightings and encounters from the same year in Maryland that are worth analyzing to see if we can find any connections.

00;07;33;08 - 00;07;58;06
Unknown
In October of 1958, less than 50 miles from only Maryland, we can find a blue Book documented case on the Loch Raven Reservoir. I bring this case up because it occurred three and a half miles away from another Nike Ajax missile site, BA oh three. At 10:30 p.m.. Alvin Cohen and Philip Small were driving on route 146, a mere 600 to 900ft from the bridge at Loch Raven Reservoir.

00;07;58;09 - 00;08;20;22
Unknown
It is then they observed a 100ft long egg shaped object, hover 100 to 150ft over the bridge. When within 75ft of the craft, their car stalled and the dash lights turned off. The two observed the UFO from outside the car for about 30 to 45 seconds, before the craft emitted a beam of white light, making the men's faces grow hot.

00;08;20;24 - 00;08;46;22
Unknown
After hearing what they described as a dull explosion, the UFO rose vertically and disappeared within five to 10s. The men were later treated for sunburns on their exposed skin. I highly recommend reading about this case in Jay Allen High next, the UFO experience. Link in description. Another relevant case occurred on the 29th of September, 1958 at the W 93 Ajax missile site, the same possible site.

00;08;46;23 - 00;09;13;10
Unknown
I am guessing Haaland may have been stationed at 5:30 a.m.. Private Jerome A Scanlon, was walking from his sentry post back to barracks when he heard a curious humming sound above him. Looking up, he sees a teardrop shaped object 300ft above him, coming in for a landing at roughly 30 miles an hour. The object moved over trees, sliced branches, and landed about 1.5 miles away.

00;09;13;12 - 00;09;35;22
Unknown
The luminous green skin on the object illuminated the nearby terrain. The craft then rose off the ground and out of sight. Scanlon and Renee Ferris, a sergeant who also saw the object, went to the site landing only to observe broken branches and scorched earth. Comically, Yousuf had an official explanation for this case, and it was in fact repair trucks welding.

00;09;35;28 - 00;10;01;17
Unknown
Bentley also speaks about an incident that occurred in 1967 or 1968, while doing NASA classified contracting work at a location in California. This incident occurred while, quote unquote, our astronauts were doing a loop around the moon and back. This leads me to conclude this alleged incident occurred onboard Apollo eight, the first mission to orbit around the moon on October 11th, 1968, while the astronauts were enroute to the moon.

00;10;01;18 - 00;10;29;08
Unknown
Haaland overheard Houston control communication with the Apollo crew. I heard the expression of the bogey coming in 11:00. Familiar with that particular term, my perked my ears and started listening a little bit and discovered that, Houston and the astronauts were talking back and forth about a collision, and then the astronauts asked for permission to do avoidance for a collision.

00;10;29;08 - 00;10;53;21
Unknown
And here's the finally granted that permission to do that. And after the after the calm length settled down a little bit, the astronaut said, no, that's not necessary. They are now paralleling our course. And there was a discussion as to what was paralleling that. Of course, there was another type of ship. There were portals there that they could see, and they could see beings of some sort.

00;10;53;23 - 00;11;18;13
Unknown
They did not describe these beings. They just took photographs. And after a while, a few thousand miles, and then they took off from there capsule that they were flying in and went away. They just said it was saucer, like a saucer like craft craft house that was paralleling their craft, actually paralleling their craft. And it was just far enough away.

00;11;18;13 - 00;11;47;00
Unknown
They couldn't really distinguish. They saw movement, they saw something in some thing, somebody moving inside there and inside that ship just before the landing. Yes, it was probably in 68, 67, maybe someone at that time frame. All they said was they, there they go. And they went out of sight almost immediately from there, from when their conversation, it was unedited because of where I was.

00;11;47;05 - 00;12;08;28
Unknown
Harland claimed there was solely a singular gentleman with him when he overheard this transmission. Who told Bentley, quote, you did not hear anything, end quote. Bentley said the reaction of Houston control astronauts were stoic, like this was no big thing. And there's really not much to go off here. But you know me, we hear Apollo eight possible and I encounter we investigate.

00;12;09;01 - 00;12;34;12
Unknown
In Steven Greer's UFO whistleblower and witness list, we find a redacted entry of an individual in government. His bio reads, quote saw the official uncut version of the NASA film footage depicting six UFOs descending onto the moon's surface, taken by astronaut Frank Borman during Apollo eight. In 1968. Borman had famously what the media ran with as a UFO sighting on board NASA Gemini eight.

00;12;34;12 - 00;13;09;27
Unknown
In December of 1965. I, I can tell you on the back of your head what 37 go ahead. I'm talking about nine up. This is Houston. So again seven. I don't have to go here on Roger Shelby control here. Again, the reference in that conversation was, bogey. It was, Borman who reported sighting the bogey eight. This is Germany controlled Houston.

00;13;09;27 - 00;13;36;06
Unknown
That, it is worth noting Borman himself stated the quote unquote bogey of this incident was just the rockets own booster. But an alleged film showing six UFOs descending on to the moon surface is quite the allegation and absolutely warrants investigation. Here we see this witnessed is tagged as number 10179 on Greer's Disclosure Project archives. We can actually find files and emails with this witness.

00;13;36;08 - 00;14;04;06
Unknown
Greer. And this source first planned to meet in April of 2009. The source was traveling from France and would be accompanied by a high profile French astronaut. The two planned to connect via phone in late February. We can see Greer's first note from February 24th, 2009, with this witness labeled AB curse you, Greer, for this handwriting, I can make out the two discussing hoaxes and truth, redacted names of trustworthy and untrustworthy individuals.

00;14;04;09 - 00;14;30;17
Unknown
And I personally cannot decipher if Borman is mentioned within this transcript. NASA is only brought up by AB questioning if the institution is trustworthy, to which Greer states, most NASA employees know nothing. On the 28th of February 2009, the source forwarded Greer a L'Express article from France pointing to a section titled A pilot from NASA. The article discusses the white House planning to appoint the next director of NASA.

00;14;30;18 - 00;14;57;10
Unknown
It then goes on to talk about who's in the running and Charles, Colonel associate administrator under Clinton, finally referencing Bolden, who has four space shuttle flights under his belt. Were these the NASA pilots, especially Bolden, the two referenced in the handwritten notes we saw with redacted names on early March 2009. We can see an email chain from Steven Greer regarding transmission of briefing documents toward the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy.

00;14;57;12 - 00;15;21;22
Unknown
And here we see it. Greer burned his source one a bowtie. A is listed as the man bringing the documents to the French president. Using the context of these emails, I was able to even find out this source one Alain Boudicca, who around this time of these emails was appointed president of the French national aeronautical and astronautical association Unidentified Aerospace Phenomena Division.

00;15;21;22 - 00;15;53;13
Unknown
The three. And as of this writing of this video, I have actually reached out to both hoping to learn more about this Apollo eight alleged film. Because where I stand, I can find zero references or lines of research to this alleged night incident. Or in his film on Apollo eight, a lot of tangents from Mr. Harlan Bentley here, but I think these claims parallel other investigations of UAP at this time, and they are fascinating.

00;15;53;15 - 00;16;22;21
Unknown
Next, I want to cover former U.S. Senator Barry Goldwater, who attempted to peek behind the veil of UFO secrecy. Goldwater served as a major general in the USAF reserve, Senator of Arizona from 53 to 65 and 69 to 87, and even ran as Republican nominee for president in 1964. In 1975, Goldwater made a powerful statement during an interview about UFO secrecy to the American public.

00;16;22;23 - 00;17;04;04
Unknown
I think the government does know I can't back that up, but I think that, at Wright-Patterson Field, if you could get into certain places, you find out what the Air Force and the government knows about UFOs reportedly, a spaceship landed and was all hushed up, quieted. Nobody ever. I've never heard about much of it. I called Curve Haslam, and I said, general, I know we have a room at Wright-Patterson where you put all this sacred stuff.

00;17;04;07 - 00;17;28;14
Unknown
Can I go in there? I've never heard him get mad, but he got mad and held me, cast me out. Said, don't ever ask me that question again. Before we get into these claims, I'd like to analyze a couple excerpts from letters written by Goldwater to UFO researchers regarding Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, compiled by one of my inspirations, Leonard Stringfield.

00;17;28;17 - 00;17;51;00
Unknown
If you all remember back, I first referenced Stringfield in my Kingman Crash video. Since then, his status reports on crash retrieval has become a Bible of sorts for me. In a letter to Stringfield from December 3rd, 1974, Goldwater wrote he had been agnostic towards UFOs throughout his life with the amount of stars in our galaxy, he reckoned life may very well exist outside of our planet.

00;17;51;00 - 00;18;17;21
Unknown
He states, quote, I made an effort to get into the room at Wright-Patterson Field where the information was stored, and I was denied this request. Years later, Goldwater was still interested in the quote unquote, Blue Room. Writing to UFO researcher Lee Graham in October 19th, 1981, stating, quote, I don't know of anyone who has access to the Blue Room, nor am I aware of its content, and I am not aware of anything having been relocated.

00;18;17;23 - 00;18;41;26
Unknown
This thing has gotten so highly classified, even though I will admit there is a lot of it that has been released, it is just impossible to get anything on it and quote Goldwater also wrote to an unknown UFO researcher say not sure who this is on March 28th, 1975. Here, Goldwater stated, for a long time he had been interested in UFOs without a strong belief 10 or 12 years before.

00;18;41;26 - 00;19;06;16
Unknown
So the early 1960s may be 1963. And remember that date quote I made an effort to find out what was in the building at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, where the information is stored that has been collected by the Air Force. And I was understandably denied this request. It is still classified above top secret, end quote. The storage of UFOs, materials or bodies at Wright Patch should not come as a shock.

00;19;06;20 - 00;19;34;17
Unknown
I will plan to do a full video on this famous site as I bring it up pretty much every other video, but I will leave you with this. April 27th, 1953 Air Force Office of Special Investigate document regarding an interview of Master Sergeant Ralph Brown from Captain Planet. Brown relayed a message he had been with a redacted gentleman, who informed him that Wright Pat had in its possession a total of three flying saucers, one damaged and two functional.

00;19;34;20 - 00;19;59;18
Unknown
The base also had the bodies of the pilots on board. I include this document because even with the suppression of the Roswell event in 1947 to 1978, rumors of the craft and bodies surrounding Wright Pat Air Force Base were nothing new around this time, and it's interesting to see Goldwater plainly tell that General Curtis LeMay grew angry with him and told him to stop the pursuit of the Blue Room.

00;19;59;21 - 00;20;32;09
Unknown
Yes, the same LeMay who said after World War Two that U.S should be allowed to develop unhindered with no restrictions, limitations or hindrance to their air supremacy. The next war will be fought out fast. It could be a war of rockets, radar, television, guided missiles and atomic power before the next war. The Air Force must be allowed to develop unhindered.

00;20;32;11 - 00;21;04;01
Unknown
Unchained. There must be no ceiling, no boundaries, no limitations to our air development. And worthy to note, two is the 1990 9th July move on UFO Journal issue, in which Lamar's name is tied to a fascinating UFO encounter. In this incident, LeMay was present at a close encounter between a fan named Jay Scorpion and a 30ft object with four blue white lights at James Connelly Air Force Base.

00;21;04;01 - 00;21;38;08
Unknown
After a near collision, the object darted off vertically to disappear at 90,000ft in this enigmatic blue room in a foyer request from Bryan Parks in 1991, Yusuf Colonel Eddie L Anderson responded by saying materials relating to a blue room, in this case a film, was destroyed on the 9th of September 1965, which is of course, curiously, around the time of Senator Goldwater's request.

00;21;38;11 - 00;22;05;08
Unknown
And now we get to a whistleblower who may have, in fact, guarded the enigmatic Blue Room I just spoke of. I want to add, we cannot verify this whistleblower's claims, let alone his identity. But I find the story so interesting, especially in conjunction with Goldwater. I have to give it a mention in Leonard String Fields UFO Crash Retrieval Status Report five, we can find a case titled Marine Guards A Disk Shaped Vehicle.

00;22;05;08 - 00;22;31;14
Unknown
1963. This case discusses how UFO researcher Michael Johnstone arranged to connect Stringfield with a former marine, who claimed in 1963 he stood guard at an undisclosed military base which housed a disc shaped vehicle. Fast forward to the 2000, where researcher and incredible CAD artist Michael Sharratt was allowed to access the late string fields personal archives, locked away in new font.

00;22;31;14 - 00;23;05;11
Unknown
Cincinnati. Within these journals, Sherratt finally uncovered the entire story of this enigmatic RB Michael found in string Fields notes. Letters between the researcher and Michael B Johnstone discussing RB this RB served in the Marines from 1960 to 66 as a weapons tech, and was a corporal who possessed an interim top secret security clearance. Quote, for two weeks in December of 1963, he was the guard, or one of the guards in charge of security for a large metal building on an undisclosed military base.

00;23;05;14 - 00;23;38;17
Unknown
The building housed a craft of a type unknown to him, end quote. And I do want to mention we do see this witness RB under Stephen Greer's witness list as a redacted name, numbered 10138. Unfortunately, like the Hartland case in the French astronauts, we don't have any documents leading us down a rabbit hole to discover his identity. To get to this location, RB had boarded a windowless plane and was flown three hours from Cherry Point, North Carolina marine Corps Air Station to a location he would not reveal.

00;23;38;19 - 00;24;06;09
Unknown
One possible location within this range is, of course, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. The vehicle was disc shaped, 40ft long, totally symmetrical, and featured an ovoid cross-section. It appeared silver ish with a polished aluminum appearance similar to many craft descriptions. Quote. The craft was totally seamless, except for a hatch like seam on the lower part of the craft, which was so well fitted you could not get a razor blade in the crack.

00;24;06;12 - 00;24;27;24
Unknown
The craft featured no landing gear, fins, propulsion, etc. what looked to be as windows lined the edge of the craft, spaced one foot apart from each other, and with the appearance of smoked glass from Arby's own words quote, you couldn't see in them even if you got right up close to them. End quote. The craft was almost hamburger shaped.

00;24;27;27 - 00;24;51;06
Unknown
This UFO sat elevated five feet off the ground, surrounded by scaffolding, joined by 3 to 4 other guards. Arby observed a technical crew working on the craft. Attempting to gain entry. He observed drilling and cutting with torches near the hatch, all to no avail. RB stated quote metal got hot under the torch, but when it cooled you could wipe off the soot and the surface remained clean and undamaged.

00;24;51;06 - 00;25;22;02
Unknown
End quote RB even claims to have observed attempts to cut into the craft via a high powered laser powered by two semi sized trailer generator fans. The beams completely deflected off the craft, damaging the ceiling. During this time, RB observe civilian scientists make specific mentions about aliens, leading him to realize this craft was not made by humans. Within the facility, strict rules were implemented, color coded security badges corresponded with color coded areas.

00;25;22;04 - 00;25;45;27
Unknown
Engineers and scientists had access to only their allocated parts of a craft. However, a red badge provided total access to the vehicle. A white tape circle surrounded the craft, which not even use RF generals could cross, RB stated. He even stopped the Secretary of the Navy from crossing this line. During his guard duty, RB snapped an image of the craft using a small German pocket camera.

The image was purported to be lost in a flood around 83 and one day. Reporting for duty, RB observed the craft being prepped for transport. Sitting on a flatbed trailer. He was told it was being shuttled from base to base for quote unquote security reasons. The marine made no assertions to witnessing bodies. However, he had heard second hand stories of retrievals, recovering bodies of beans 39in tall with no thumbs that were stored in an underground base in a western state.

When exiting the Marines, RB was forced to sign a security oath that carried with it a ten year prison sentence and $10,000 fine for violation. In 2015, Michael Sherratt was able to interview Michael Johnstone and was able to gather some additional pieces of this story I have used here in this video. Huge thank you for all of his time and effort on this case.

What's up guys? Thank you so much for watching and I hope you enjoyed our second entry investigating UFO whistleblowers. As I said in the first video, we will be tackling all types of whistleblowers, whether it's people with solid affidavits like Hot and Love Kin or a little more enigmatic claims without much to back them up like Hartland Bentley here, regardless of the fact I find Heartland's claim super interesting, especially about the Ajax missile crash and how the UFO he saw struck the ground and then departed back into flight.

As far as his Apollo eight claims, I am not quite sure what to make of those. As we saw in the video, there's a pretty deep rabbit hole of Steven Greer connected to an alleged Apollo eight film depicting UFOs descending on to the moon's surface. And while this is unrelated to Hartland Bentley's claims of if I can do some investigation there and find out there's some real meat to this case, that could lend some credence to the fact the Apollo eight crew encountered some sort of craft on their way to the moon.

As far as Barry Goldwater in the Blue Room, I wanted to include that just to kind of show you guys, if you haven't heard about him, some really powerful statements made by some pretty important people in US American history, especially how Goldwater knocks on the door of right pad and is denied access to the quote unquote, Blue Room.

00;27;59;17 - 00;28;19;21

One possible explanation to that Blue Room may be Rwby. And I hope you guys enjoyed that story, because as of right now, that's one of the most fascinating, kind of military encounters I can cover. And I can think of behind the scenes. I'm doing some more investigation with that. I might have a lead to where I can know this man's name.

00;28;19;24 - 00;28;42;22

If that's the case, I'd like to try and get in contact with him. But seeing as he was in his late 40s in the 1986 interview he did with Michael B Johnstone. Time is running out and I hope he's still alive. And I hope he might want to speak. I might reach out to Stratton, try and get some help on that case, because I just find that so interesting, especially that craft description propped up on scaffolding.

The white line, the different color coded badges. And with that craft, even though the shape in the windows is a bit anomalous in terms of what we hear as described with classic saucer cigars and so forth, I find the super strong material and the seem similar to Machu Picchu. You can even put a paper between. I find that so fascinating in that case is really of interest to me.

I'm so happy I found that, and I do think it's interesting that witnesses listed in in Greer's witness list. Has he spoken to Greer? I don't know. All I know is this ARB has never gone public with his story, nor tried to make any sensational claims or make a dime from it. I think one quote from Michael Sharratt is Rb's wife didn't believe the story until she actually saw the photograph before it was lost.

00;29;35;19 - 00;30;01;03

And of course, with photographic evidence that somehow pops up and is lost. That's always a red flag. However, in this case I will give it a pass until I know more. But I hope you guys enjoyed this. If there's any specific whistleblowers you want to see in future entries, just let me know. I have a long list, some credible, some not, some fantastical claim, some not that I want to cover and I won't be covering, kind of the big hitters like Bob Lazar.

They, want their own video and even some more enigmatic guys that I can put off like an hour or two of content on, such as microbiologist Dan Barish. If you're watching now, that's probably going to be a video I make in the future. That in Project Aquarius is extremely interesting. But if there's any other whistleblowers you guys want to see covered or crash retrieval cases, please let me know.

In terms of crash retrievals, my friends. I got the mecha right here. Magic eyes only Ryan, as would he and I, recently connected on the phone. I spoke to him. He's a brilliant man. Brilliant book. I fully recommend this piece if you're interested in crash retrievals. This is kind of like my handbook. Besides, Leonard Springfield's crash retrieval reports one through seven.

When I'm investigating the crash, you know what I do? I'll pop up this book. I'm not sponsored, by the way. This is just such a good book. But please, guys, remember to like and subscribe. I got a Patreon link in description if you think the channel is worth anything, donate what you can afford and what you think the channel is worth.

I'm not going to gatekeeper any of my content. So, you know, I don't have any podcast or extra good videos behind the scenes that you can't get if you're not paying. I appreciate every single one of you being here, and I will catch you guys on the next show. Thank you so much.
