# UFOs in the Private Sector - Lockheed Martin

## Description

Lockheed Martin in our sights after tackling [[UAP]] and [[Battelle Memorial Institute]]. This video explores [[Lockheed Martin]]'s alleged involvement with UFO technology, potential [[Reverse Engineering]] programs, and classified projects related to [[UAP]] research. We analyze claims from key figures such as former Senate Majority Leader [[Harry Reid]], [[Lockheed Senior Scientist Boyd Bushman]], [[Lockheed Astrophysicist Bernard Haisch]], and alleged [[Skunkworks]] engineer [[Don Phillips]]. Additionally, we review [[Project Aurora]]/[[Astra]] and its connection to the black triangle craft ([[TR-3B]]).
