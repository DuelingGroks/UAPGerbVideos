### 📅 ### Overview & Background

- **Location & Mission**: Dugway Proving Ground (DPG) is in Utah, roughly 85 miles southwest of Salt Lake City, spanning 1,250 square miles—larger than the entire state of Rhode Island. Its stated mission is primarily chemical and biological weapons testing.
- **Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB)**: DPG hosts the West Desert Test Center, and also shares part of the Utah Test and Training Range (UTTR) with Hill Air Force Base. MRTFBs are considered “critical cores” for DoD test and evaluation, and Dugway is one of 23 acknowledged MRTFB sites.
- **Rumored Successor to Area 51**: The facility has long been called “Area 52” in UFO lore, with suggestions that some programs once based at Area 51 may have been moved to Dugway due to shifting secrecy requirements and heavy public attention on Groom Lake.

> **Add to your notes**: Mention DPG’s status as an Army MRTFB and its shared boundaries with the Air Force’s UTTR. This underscores the idea that Dugway might coordinate with both Army and Air Force units on classified aerospace or UAP-related programs.

### 🛸 Key Claims & Allegations

1. **Successor to Area 51**
    
    - Various sources—ranging from Popular Mechanics in 1997 to whistleblower statements—claim that 30–40% of “legacy UFO programs” moved from Area 51 to Dugway.
2. **Underground Facilities (DUMBs)**
    
    - Witness accounts refer to a deep underground installation known as the “Avery” or “Avery Technical Center” region within Dugway, possibly housing advanced or “non-human technology.”
3. **Witness Testimony (M.S.)**
    
    - A defense contractor (referred to as “M.S.”) describes seeing a non-human craft inside Dugway’s restricted area around 2009 and being shown elevator shafts leading to underground hangar spaces.
4. **Corporate & Research Partners**
    
    - Defense contractors like Battelle Memorial Institute, Lockheed Skunkworks, and other federally funded research centers (FFRDC/UARC) are rumored to be involved in exotic propulsion and materials research at Dugway.
5. **UAP Sightings & Testing**
    
    - Frequent UFO/UAP sightings in the Utah desert near DPG (e.g., a 1967 “fluxliner”-type disk and other alleged advanced craft) have fueled speculation of secret reverse-engineering or experimental vehicle testing.

> **Add to your notes**: Emphasize the references to the Avery underground region, since that is central to many testimonies. Also highlight the mention of UTTR (Air Force side) working in tandem with the Army’s West Desert Test Center—both of which might be testing advanced aerospace craft.

### 🔍 Key Whistleblower & Research Findings

- **M.S. (Former Contractor)**:
    
    - Claims to have seen a “non-human craft” within Dugway around 2009, as well as a massive sub-surface complex reached via large elevator platforms. Names a chief scientist on-site.
- **FOIA & Declassified Clues**:
    
    - Historical FOIA requests mention advanced propulsion studies, references to hush-hush testing, and possible ties to UTTR.
- **[[David Grusch]] (2023)**:
    
    - Alleges ongoing “non-human craft retrieval and concealment” programs across multiple DoD sites; Dugway has surfaced in speculations as a potential location.
- **Older Crash Retrieval Claims**:
    
    - A rumored 1953 UFO crash near Garrison, Utah, ~200 miles north of the better-known Kingman, Arizona, incident. Though not conclusive, it adds to the lore around DPG and southwestern Utah.

> **Add to your notes**: You might combine the older Garrison crash story with the more recent M.S. testimony to show how Dugway’s “UAP connections” span decades, at least in public rumor.

### 🛠 Official Investigations & Responses

- **Department of Defense**:
    
    - Officially denies DPG is used for any UFO-related work, emphasizing chemical/biological test missions.
- **AARO Investigations**:
    
    - The All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office has taken note of some Dugway-related UAP reports. Details remain classified.
- **Congressional Interest**:
    
    - Recent whistleblower protection legislation and UAP disclosure hearings may eventually shed more light on DPG.

> **Add to your notes**: Clarify that official channels (DoD and AARO) acknowledge the existence of UAP reports but keep any specifics about Dugway behind classified barriers.

### 🛸 Theories & Speculation

6. **Active UFO Crash Retrieval & Reverse Engineering**
    
    - Dugway’s isolation and security make it an ideal site for handling exotic craft, possibly in deeper underground hangars.
7. **Advanced Aerospace Development**
    
    - Could be a joint Army–Air Force operation testing revolutionary propulsion tech at the West Desert Test Center (Army) and the Utah Test & Training Range (Air Force).
8. **Biological & Psychological Experimentation**
    
    - Some suspect that if non-human craft or materials have biological components, Dugway’s chemical/biological labs might be leveraged for research—and potentially more controversial human/UAP interface studies.
9. **Relocation from Area 51**
    
    - Multiple whistleblowers say that heightened public attention on Area 51 in the 1990s led to transferring some programs—possibly 30–40%—to the secluded infrastructure at DPG.

> **Add to your notes**: Note the synergy of chemical/biological testing expertise with rumored exotic materials research. That combination is a key reason Dugway is singled out as a candidate site for reverse engineering.
