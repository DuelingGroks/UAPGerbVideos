In today's day and age. In 2024, we've all heard of the U.S. Dodd's videos captured of UFOs. Many of us have heard of U.S. Navy or Air Force pilots encountering UFOs on their missions, such as the testimony of Commander David Fravor and Ryan Graves. But what we hardly hear are the stories of U.S. servicemen encountering UFOs at home or overseas.

00;00;29;17 - 00;01;00;21
Unknown
Today, I'd like to tackle two alleged stories of US marine veterans getting a little too close for comfort with UAP. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back. I am UAP Gerb and welcome back for a shorter documentary style video today where we tackle two cases of Marines encountering UFOs during their service abroad. These are two fascinating stories, especially the first I'm about to tell you.

00;01;00;28 - 00;01;47;02
Unknown
So sit back, relax and think about these wild tales. It's not from Earth. I mean, I knew that when I looked at it, you know? I mean, I'm not doing this to make money. In February of 1997, USMC Lance Corporal Jonathan Wagon was transferred to to Kalpa Air Base in Peru to serve in Operation Laser Strike, a US South Com mission involving up to 20 agencies such as the USMC, CIA, USAF, etc. the goal of this mission was to counter narcotic operations in Peruvian airspace while serving as a Stinger Avenger gunner ordered to perform perimeter security for the base.

00;01;47;05 - 00;02;26;08
Unknown
Wagon would encounter something truly out of this world. Jonathan while serving with Marine Mag 28 team under command of Master Sergeant Chris Diggins and Major Bob Cole, recalled hearing USAF personnel discussing the tracking of UFOs displaying strange characteristics. Now, it's worth noting the book Kalpa Airbase employed numerous data acquisition methods, including four three, and are on air relocatable over the horizon radar, as well as CIA Cessna Citation Spotter aircrafts.

00;02;26;10 - 00;02;58;19
Unknown
So the base had numerous methods to garner Multi-Sensor detection during a late night guard detail in March or April. Jonathan, Staff Sergeant Monta Lee gray, Sergeant Allen, and Sergeant Adkins were all ordered to secure the crash site of a potentially friendly downed aircraft. We can see in the image on screen a shoot down occurred on the 25th of March by an A37, sending a target crashing into a large fire ball.

00;02;58;21 - 00;03;24;22
Unknown
By early morning, the platoon of Marines reached near the designated area, with their Humvees needing to cross the remaining distance through the bush. Jonathan himself says, quote, we found the area really easily because there was a huge gash in the land where something had landed. Wagon. Adkins and Allen went on to pursue the crashed aircraft while the remaining Marines stayed at the crash site.

00;03;24;25 - 00;03;47;15
Unknown
It's important to note this crash site is all these remaining Marines witnessed. Then we saw the object, and when I first saw it, you know, I was scared. It scared the heck out of me. You know? I didn't know what to do. And it was just I was really it was really confusing. Wiggins saw a craft with the following characteristics.

00;03;47;18 - 00;04;20;22
Unknown
Egg shaped with its narrow end jutting out of a cliff face. The craft looked metallic, but with fluctuations you'd see in a liquid. The surface was constantly changing. Described by wagon as gasoline dripping into water, large vents that looked similar to fish gills, a dull, humming sound emanated from the object, instilling fear and unease in the Marines. And finally, a large gash in the side of the object.

00;04;20;24 - 00;05;03;10
Unknown
Wiggins guessed this may have been caused by a Hawk missile system. Adkins and Allen ordered Wiggin to move away from the craft, and when the trio were departing the craft, winging it, noticed a group of men heading towards him from two landed US Army H 47 helicopters. The men were black fatigues, hazmat suits and doughy rain jackets. Wiggins was arrested, stripped of his gear, had his wrists cable tied and was taken aboard a 47 and interrogate and verbally attacked for 15 hours still to this day.

00;05;03;10 - 00;05;30;10
Unknown
But anyway, I was arrested. I had all my gear taken from me by men in black jammies, had new no name tags. They were older men, probably in their late 30s or 40s. The lieutenant Colonel Wigand was handed to forced him to sign paperwork. Jonathan didn't even read as he was so scared. Then he was lumped in with Yusuf personnel for three weeks before being sent back to the States.

00;05;30;12 - 00;06;01;28
Unknown
They had the big D, you know, Delta Oscar echo on the back of their back. And a couple of the guys were wearing like, these, these rain jackets. Forget for a second what Jonathan saw. Think about who he saw, who wears black camo with little to no insignia, alongside men in doughy rain jackets. My guess is the shadow D.o.e. special response team called Nuclear Commandos.

00;06;02;00 - 00;06;40;19
Unknown
This highly trained spec ops group has arrest authority when dealing with protection of D.O.D. National labs and assets. Special response teams at this time in 97 were made up of contractors like SGA. But let's go deeper. The D.o.e. SRT is part of Nest, the nuclear emergency search team. Nest is comprised of special forces scientists, technicians and engineers combined with US Army 52nd EOD for a variety of emergency responses.

00;06;40;22 - 00;07;11;29
Unknown
And let's note real fast that nest technical information is covered and protected. Like that of special access programs. Not to mention, the main intelligence for Nest is the National Reconnaissance Office, NRO and CIA, and supported by Doe contractors such as e.g. Raytheon and Lockheed Martin. And as we know, the Department of Energy and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission were formerly known as the AEC.

00;07;11;29 - 00;07;50;05
Unknown
The Atomic Energy Commission. This AEC has been name dropped extensively in regards to classification of crash to UFO materials and craft. Just like how they are named in the 2024 UAP NDAA legislation by Chuck Schumer stating the AEC is used to mis classify UAP records as trans classified foreign nuclear material and thus exempt from disclosure. This discussion of the D.o.e. complicit with crashed UAP gives a lot of credibility to wagon's testimony.

00;07;50;05 - 00;08;19;08
Unknown
In my opinion. Now, just for reference, the video I have been playing is against 2001 interview with Steven Greer for his Disclosure Project. After he told of this experience, wegen essentially went quiet until 2023, never trying to gain or profit from his experience. What do you think about his story? I'll give my thoughts at the end of the video, but keep this plain in your head.

00;08;19;08 - 00;08;42;09
Unknown
Think about what he said, think about the ties to the d.o.e., and think about that egg shaped craft, which is often described by people who experience the UAP, especially that of UFO whistleblower Eric Tabor, who surmised that a egg shaped craft was held in area 51. We discussed this entry in layer one of my alien and UFOs Obscure Oddities iceberg, so check that out.

00;08;42;09 - 00;09;13;04
Unknown
It's pretty interesting. Next, we move on to another man that released his story. Due to the work done by Steven Greer and his Disclosure Project, Michael Herrera. In the summer of 2023, just after the revelations of David Gross went public, Herrera featured for his first public appearance on Greer's panel with the National Press Club. Herrera story is both scintillating and extremely disturbing, if true.

00;09;13;06 - 00;09;54;14
Unknown
In fact, it's one of the strangest firsthand encounters I have ever heard. At 20 years old, in 2009, USMC Rifleman Herrera was sent to Indonesia on a humanitarian mission following the Sumatra earthquake and tsunami. In October of 2009, Herrera and five Marines were in the process of hiking a 900ft ridge to take position for a supply drop when the team spotted a strange object in the jungle, Herrera claimed to see something moving and rotating pulsating colors between a light matte gray to an absurdly dark matte black quote.

00;09;54;21 - 00;10;32;05
Unknown
The huge object, like an octagonal pyramid, was emitting a low hum and quote, Michael said as he described a scaly exterior which looked manmade but like no known type of craft. Here he saw this craft being loaded with supplies by unmarked U.S. forces. Similar to wagon. These men wore black fatigues without insignia. His unit moved in for a closer look due to not possessing radios on the short hike to the supply drop, so they couldn't radio in what they were witnessing.

00;10;32;07 - 00;10;57;11
Unknown
Getting close to the craft, the Marines were ambushed and held at gunpoint by the paramilitary unit. The men spoke in American accents and the Marines camera and gear were confiscated as they were told not to disclose the sighting. The men were eventually released, and Herrera was later told by a USAF lieutenant colonel, quote, you're not allowed to talk about what happened.

00;10;57;13 - 00;11;38;23
Unknown
You will go to prison or you will die. End quote. Herrera became emboldened to break his 14 year silence by new UFO whistleblower protections, and in April testified under oath about his wild story while also fearing reprisals for his knowledge of the going ons in the Indonesian jungle. So what did Herrera see? If his story is true, we must assume that these men were piloting an RV, an alien reproduction vehicle, and we must now realize that these arv's are real and utilized by shadow US military factions.

00;11;38;26 - 00;12;11;17
Unknown
This would mean that certain reverse engineering programs, such as discussed in the Wilson Davis memo, have succeeded in translating craft of non-human origin into human hands. Historically, there have been rumors that Lockheed Martin and their special Project Astra has been able to reverse engineer a triangular shaped aircraft known famous as the TR3 B but this craft Herrera witnessed seemed massive and octagonal in shape.

00;12;11;20 - 00;12;42;22
Unknown
But what were these unmarked men? Loading. Well, according to Herrera, unmarked trucks were preparing to load weapons onto the craft, but one truck in particular was hauling a small storage crate. Herrera only got a brief look at this crate, but described some sort of temperature, humidity, and air control system on the exterior of the crate, leading him to believe that possibly biologics and maybe even some humans or ETS were being transported within this crate.

00;12;42;25 - 00;13;08;01
Unknown
Now, I'm still in the process of learning more about this case, since Herrera has just come out publicly, but he is a native of Denver and currently resides here, so I might actually try to find his contact information and get in touch with him. So I can learn a little more from him about his experience. My friends, thank you for joining me for another video today.

00;13;08;01 - 00;13;28;16
Unknown
I wanted to take a little break from the iceberg series and make something a little more documentary style. Again, the case of Jonathan Wagon is often on my mind. I can't stop thinking about it, so I wanted to make a video on some close encounters seen by Marines. I'm going to be honest, guys, I believe the story of Jonathan Wiggin.

00;13;28;19 - 00;14;03;10
Unknown
I think the story he tells compared with his body language is credible, especially when it boils down to the doughy and the nuclear commandos. He saw the men in black insignia with the dough jackets. I just I think that is an example of the nest program and whatever part of the D.o.e. affiliated stops, I think that's them uncovering a crash retrieval and whatever that craft is, is so interesting.

00;14;03;12 - 00;14;33;00
Unknown
The way wagon describes the gills and the water over oil. Mother of pearl effect. It's just absolutely fascinating to me, especially the low humming that instilled fear in him and his fellow Marines. That's something that's very similarly encountered in many cases, some slight psychological effects of fear or calmness. So I think his story is fascinating. Now for Michael Herrera.

00;14;33;00 - 00;15;02;06
Unknown
I'm torn on his story. For one, it is true that he testified to Congress or behind closed doors in April of 2023, giving his account. But on the other hand, I know Steven Greer likes to press the RV and that most UFOs are alien reproduction vehicle theory. I am of the mind that I don't know if humans have been able to successfully reverse engineer any sort of non-human intelligence technology.

00;15;02;09 - 00;15;30;29
Unknown
If you listen to the Wilson Davis memo, if you listen to Ross Coltart, if you listen to David Grush, hell, even if you listen to Bob Lazar, they've all said whatever we have our hands on, it is so beyond human comprehension and capability that even without the agonizingly slow progress of compartmentalizing ation, they don't know if we'd ever be able to harness whatever this technology is.

00;15;30;29 - 00;15;51;03
Unknown
I mean, look at what we talked about in the first layer of the iceberg and area 51 with Eric Taylor. That egg shaped craft. It was described as smooth with no rivets or or welding areas, and it had no visible entry points into the craft. I mean, that's similarly described to Wiggins craft, but with the gills and and so forth.

00;15;51;03 - 00;16;16;16
Unknown
So I just I'm not sure about that. And if a craft has been successfully reverse engineered, it is the TR3. B that triangular craft think of the Belgian UFO wave in the 90s were so many black triangle craft were seen, usually with three LED red lights with one light seen under the middle. If anything's a human made craft, it's those triangles.

00;16;16;19 - 00;16;42;07
Unknown
But what did you guys think? Let me know in the comments. I'd like to discuss this further. I'd really like more from Wigan to sink my teeth into it, and I will reach out to Herrera if I can find him. I'd love to talk to the guy, find out more, find out the names of his fellow Marines, but will now be back to regular programing with iceberg layer three and four.

00;16;42;07 - 00;16;53;12
Unknown
And then maybe I'll make another documentary and then five and six. So stay tuned! I hope you enjoyed this mini doc and found some interest in these cases. Let me know what you think later guys.
