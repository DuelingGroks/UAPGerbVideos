## Transcript
00;00;00;00 - 00;00;31;25
Unknown
For decades, humans around the world have reported sightings of dark, triangular shaped UFOs, often featuring three bright white lights at each corner and a dull red light or structural features on the middle surface. Unlike classic flying saucers, orbs, egg shaped craft, Tic Tacs, and strange organic shapes like the controversial jellyfish, UAP triangles have historically not been associated with non-human intelligence, but instead with deep sixed black budget human reverse engineering efforts.

00;00;31;27 - 00;01;17;16
Unknown
This is somewhat due to triangular craft lacking many of the hallmarks of what some would consider an high craft. No visible means of propulsion, a lack of harsh angles and surface features, missing rivets, bolts and seams, as well as many triangular sightings occurring in concentrated periods over populated regions and military bases. Triangle craft were further touched upon in the fall 2024 UAP hearings, in which the shadowy, unacknowledged special access program Immaculate Constellation saw its public report released to Congress and the American people at least some of the triangles among the rarest UAP configurations reported in the Immaculate Constellation report have been confirmed by the use apt to be a RV.

00;01;17;17 - 00;01;48;06
Unknown
Alien reproduction vehicles the same term used by presiding program members to label the Flux Liner. Flying saucer reproduction vehicle observed by Brad Sorensen at the 1988 Norton Air Force Base Show, and Representative Eric Burleson told me this was not the first time. In fact, he had heard the term RV, and I've seen this in some, and he had conversations about this with people from the UFO community that will say that there's two types of aircraft.

00;01;48;06 - 00;02;17;03
Unknown
There is, there's a craft that is truly extraterrestrial, and then there's craft that we have reverse engineered and created and, and or reproduce. And so that that report, what is unique about the Immaculate Conception report is about these reproduced, you know, basically us reproducing what what is but are these triangles whose descriptions are oftentimes near identical, indeed human made.

00;02;17;05 - 00;02;50;04
Unknown
What can we make of the whistleblower testimony of Edgar Shea, who describe these craft in great detail, including the name, the TR Tactical Reconnaissance? Three b what valuable evidence can we gather from slightly different triangle variations seen from the 1980s and 1990s? And why would the X-Files TV show contract a triangle design from an artist who drew an alleged reverse engineered craft called the Ex-F1 31 Super Sentinel, instructed by two Lockheed Martin and two Northrop Grumman engineers.

00;02;50;06 - 00;03;31;23
Unknown
Hey guys, it's UAP Gerber, and I am thrilled for you to join me on another investigation into alien reproduction vehicles, this time focusing on the black triangles seen throughout the globe for decades. Let's venture into the full story of the TR three b RV, a possible parallel joint Northrop and Lockheed RV. Hailing from the Lockheed Martin Hallandale plan and strange possible RV prototypes seen throughout the 1980s and 1990s with odd features, let us investigate the origins, configurations, and purposes of these craft allegedly built from any high technology.

00;03;31;26 - 00;03;59;01
Unknown
On November 13th, 2024, the term RV was entered into the Congressional Hearing Record with the Immaculate Constellation Report No. This term did not originate with Steven Greer in 2001. It can indeed be traced back to 1988, with alleged firsthand witness Brad Sorensen, who observed DoD and private industry attempts to reverse engineer anti-gravity, flying saucer craft and now the Immaculate Constellation unknown.

00;03;59;01 - 00;04;33;07
Unknown
Anonymous a whistleblower report has labeled another craft configuration as alien reproduction vehicles. The triangle. The report, whose historical data tracked back to 2009, discussed a large equilateral triangle directly appearing over intelligence collecting vessels captured by Indo-Pak. Com. The US, Indo-Pacific command. The triangle hovered and rotated slowly 500 to 1000m above the ocean. Three bright points were seen at each bottom corner of the horizontally rotating triangle, with a horizontal bar of sweeping lights.

00;04;33;07 - 00;04;58;19
Unknown
Partially observed collected intelligence revealed this triangle was a reproduction craft. A second Indo-Pak commentary detailed a fighter jet sized equilateral RV triangle of unknown origin, hovering less than 200m above a vessel at least two lights were observed on the craft, with at least one more obstructed on the underside of the craft, with the triangle slightly positioned at an upward angle.

00;04;58;22 - 00;05;33;00
Unknown
In their 2023 and 2024 historical reports, arrow listed triangles as solely 3 to 4% of all reported UAPs, a morphology that is indeed quite uncommon. Project Bluebook, the U.S. Air Force's official UFO investigation program from 1952 to 1969, cataloged over 12,000 cases of varying quality. Let's reference this paper titled The Bluebook Unknowns by Dawn Berliner, which utilizes numerous criteria to analyze only the most unexplained of Blue Book cases in the 1950s.

00;05;33;00 - 00;06;04;21
Unknown
We find solely for recorded anomalous triangle sightings. These triangles are often described as colorful, a far cry from our dark gray black craft with three lights the subject of today's analysis. Although Aero and Bluebook are not necessarily trustworthy, we can form a strong observation here analyzing historical UFO reporting trends. Thank you to UFO search.com and Richard Sheldrake. We can directly observe the time period of 1940 to 1970 and 2000 to modern day.

00;06;04;28 - 00;06;50;12
Unknown
See few triangular craft sightings reported 1970 to 2000, particularly the 1980s and 1990s. See an overwhelming number of reported triangular UFO sightings. Not only does this confirm the data and claims made further in this video, but this also suggests a worldwide multi-decade UFO flap of triangle shaped craft. With the cases and testimony we will explore in this video, a strong thesis could be constructed that sometime in the 1970s, legacy UFO programs began constructing triangular alien reproduction vehicles based on non-human triangular craft, and iterated on and tested such craft over military bases during the 1980s to 2000.

00;06;50;14 - 00;07;17;03
Unknown
And let's also reference the controversial majestic 12 document titled Psalm 101, or the Special Operations Manual. I covered at length with Ryan Wood in the description of craft from this document, allegedly dated 1954. We can find description of triangular shaped craft amongst the saucers, spheres, cigars, etc. the triangles read quote. This craft is believed to be new technology due to the rarity and recency of observations.

00;07;17;08 - 00;07;57;22
Unknown
Radar indicates an isosceles triangle profile, the longest side being nearly 300ft in length. Little is known about the performance of these craft due to the rarity of good sightings, but they are believed to be capable of high speeds and abrupt maneuvers similar to or exceeding the performance attributed to types A and C in the midst of a slew of anonymous triangular sightings with strange lights and fixtures in the 1980s and 1990s, which we will discuss later, the 1989 Belgian UFO wave arose, all too often associated with the Patrick M hoax photograph or labeled a case of mass delusion, the Belgian Triangle UFO wave has incredible amounts of worthwhile investigation.

00;07;57;22 - 00;08;22;20
Unknown
The wave is not the subject of today's video, but let's briefly discuss. In November of 1989, hundreds of reports surfaced from Belgium of a large, flat, triangular shaped craft with lights underneath flying at low altitudes. The event culminated on the night of March 30th, 1990, where an unknown object was tracked by radar and pursued by two Belgian F-16 fighters who were unable to locate the triangle.

00;08;22;23 - 00;08;50;11
Unknown
Internal DoD documents, once classified, revealed U.S. authorities investigated the case and even confirmed to the Belgian Air Force and Ministry of Defense that no Yousef stealth aircraft, such as the B-2 or F-117, were used in the region. But what if this wave of sighting, strangely caught on radar on March 30th, 1990, was a series of tests over an allied nation of a stealth craft even more secret than the B-2 and F-117.

00;08;50;18 - 00;09;12;28
Unknown
What if this aircraft program was deep sixed and embedded within special access programs, within reach of only those with need to know access in the highest clearances the U.S had to offer? What if this craft was the TR three B reverse engineered triangle?

00;09;13;01 - 00;09;40;11
Unknown
In at least three of my projects, I've mentioned the testimony of USAF Master Sergeant Edgar Fu Shaye and his claims of anti-gravity, reverse engineer triangular craft called TR three B black budget operations involving Nellis Area 51 and Edwards Air Force Base, and involvement of contractors such as Lockheed Martin and non-human intelligence technology exploitation. Well, now is finally the time to explore his entire testimony.

00;09;40;13 - 00;10;06;21
Unknown
Edgar Albert Bouchet, sometimes referred to as Edgar Rothschild, who was born in 1948, in south central Georgia to fifth generation Americans. His family history consisted of numerous individuals in military, intelligence and classified projects during the Vietnam conflict. While attending college, Fucci worked as a machinist making bombs. In 1968, the young man was drafted into USAF for para rescue basic training.

00;10;06;25 - 00;10;39;12
Unknown
After fracturing his ankle at Fort Benning, Edgar completed training in electronics, communication, intelligence, and crypto logical methods. From 64 to 74, Shea was stationed at Myriad Tactical Air Command and Air Training Command bases, including 3.5 years stationed in Vietnam and surrounding Asian bases within USAF, who earned degrees in electronics and avionics engineering, as well as a bachelor's in Business and enjoyed numerous awards and a prestigious reputation for his advanced skill set, often sought after by military brass.

00;10;39;19 - 00;11;08;13
Unknown
In the late 1970s, Shea would see a series of USF mandated stations at the now infamous Groom Lake Area 51 facility with a top secret clearance with Crypto access through. Shea was considered an Air Force expert with classified electronic countermeasure test equipment, crypto logical test equipment, and automatic test equipment, all while receiving around 4000 hours of technical training from USG and DoD, half of which was classified late in his career.

00;11;08;13 - 00;11;34;24
Unknown
Working eight years as a defense contractor and engineering manager who dealt with classified black programs, developing state of the art electronics, logistic and technical data, and automatic testing equipment. The Master Sergeant participated as a handpicked key member to work on USAF fighters such as the F-15 Eagle air superiority fighter, the A-10 warthog, the P1 Lancer bomber, and the F-117, a stealth fighter.

00;11;34;26 - 00;11;59;22
Unknown
Russia claimed to have worked alongside the Defense Advanced Research Center in 1979, which he stated was a minimum ten story underground facility between area 51. Groom Lake Fucci was recruited to Groom Lake out of his station at Edwards Air Force Base Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which he claimed also consisted of deep underground facilities. The Defense Advanced Research Center, not to be confused with DARPA.

00;11;59;23 - 00;12;25;02
Unknown
The Defense Advanced Research Project Agency was actually a proposed institution. Let's reference this declassified advanced project research agency Arpa. A lot of acronyms I know study written in 1973. This study was written as a historical evaluation of the R&D management institution Arpa, who at this time had established remarkably little in the way of official record or institutional memory.

00;12;25;05 - 00;12;52;10
Unknown
On page 82 of the document under Arpa laboratories discussing advanced aerospace projects, we find a DoD directive showing the Army Ballistic Missile Agency was considered for transfer into the Defense Advanced Research Center, linking the department to the aforementioned Jet Propulsion Laboratory. And it is worth noting the Army Ballistic Missile Agency was commanded by Nazi V-2 rocket scientist and Operation Paperclip transfer Verner von Braun.

00;12;52;13 - 00;13;12;16
Unknown
Von Braun's mentor, was father of German rocketry Hermann Oberth, who performed extensive study on UFOs. But back to future. It was here at Daas he would work with advanced digital technologies and gain knowledge of human made, reverse engineered craft.

00;13;12;19 - 00;13;44;23
Unknown
Master Sergeant Edgar Fucci made his first public disclosures regarding reverse engineered anti-gravity triangular craft called TR3 b in his 1998 book Alien Rapture, and presented this data for Mouffe on the mutual UFO network in IE UFO, see the international UFO Congress. After years of interviews, research and preparation, these disclosures were sourced from five close friends within DoD and classified programs, as well as for Shays firsthand experience at area 51 Groom Lake in the DRC.

00;13;44;29 - 00;14;12;05
Unknown
We will focus mostly on his 1998 II UFO C presentation as it serves as an extremely comprehensive baseline summary of Shay's testimony, while also pulling clips and contextually relevant data from other sources and future interviews. His book Alien Rapture is extremely similar to Secret Machines by Tom DeLonge, where alleged nonfiction events are shrouded in a guise of fiction to protect names, dates, and locations.

00;14;12;07 - 00;14;45;02
Unknown
Fu 98 testimony revolved around the revelations of secret government technology and reverse engineered extraterrestrial artifacts. Edgar set out with the specific goal of informing the public on the facts behind the infamously cited Flying Triangles. Forum three you know exactly what the Flying Triangle is the one that's been cited around the world. It's the most exotic, unclassified aerospace vehicle that's ever been built, and it may be stealthily hovering over Phoenix, Belgium, or your city.

00;14;45;04 - 00;15;10;08
Unknown
And we must know, outside of his own personal sightings of the craft while in service, Fucci did not work on the TR three B he relayed much of the data he gathered around the TR three B from his five close sources. Let's discuss these five close sources who built much of the foundation for future disclosures. Edgar. His closest ally was Gerald, a former National Security Agency investigator and Treat team member.

00;15;10;14 - 00;15;39;07
Unknown
Treat stands for the Tactical Reconnaissance Engineering Assessment Team, aka what we might call the Men in Black. I can find only one publicly available mention of treat and this is from Lichtenstein, means Crown Prince Hans Adams. In a letter to Doctor Steven Greer dated August 31st, 1997, this letter from an unknown sender discusses Hans Adams and his mention in a book by author Tom Bowers called Nazi Gold.

00;15;39;09 - 00;16;06;22
Unknown
Hans had previously spoken and collaborated with Greer on UAP issues to an unknown degree. This sender accused the Crown Prince of having supported counterintelligence operations against the American people on the subject of UFOs, and in this letter, the sender directly accused Hans Adams of funding treat quote. Adams funding should be focused on his support for treat and its grande dame, who is wed to a former U.S. Army general.

00;16;06;27 - 00;16;40;06
Unknown
Ex-Head of Army Intelligence and Security Command. End quote. The general in question here is U.S. Army general and founder of the US Army Intelligence and Security Command, INS comm. Albert Stubble Bin. Now, I have good reason to believe Army INS comm is likely associated with UFO crash retrievals, but we will discuss this in a future project. Major General Albert Double blind himself, allegedly intimidated Steven Greer to discontinue investigating UFO black projects and the level of corruption is worrisome.

00;16;40;06 - 00;17;15;16
Unknown
Now, in 92, General Albert's double blind, a third, Burt, who had been head of special forces and Army intelligence, fought with tuco. He intercepted me after we had this major contact event out in Florida. And there Pensacola. And he subsequently, about a month later, personally offered me $2 billion to not pursue what I was doing and become part of his team and stumble by is currently witness ten, six, five, eight.

00;17;15;16 - 00;17;46;27
Unknown
In Greer's witness log, his witness description reads quote has been involved since the 1960s. Former head of Fort Hood Kuka Army intelligence, where 80 craft and bodies are stored and quote. What we can learn here is that quite possibly treat is the real life Men in Black housed within U.S. Army INS comm. Okay, but back to Fucci. In the first of the five disclosure advocates and team members, Gerald Tree stands for Tactical Reconnaissance Engineering Assessment Team.

00;17;46;29 - 00;18;16;20
Unknown
I think some of you called me in and by. They work for the Department of Energy and the National Security Security Agency. This was his cover, but ultimately the National Security Agency controlled all his movements and everything he did. His job required him to watch employees with top secret and Q clearances and other classified clearances at the Nevada Test Site, the Nellis Range, Los Alamos, Sandia and many other bases.

00;18;16;23 - 00;18;38;23
Unknown
He spent a lot of time out at area 51 for years before I even knew what he was involved in this, where the, previously the most classified aerospace testing in the world took place. You may know it as Groom Lake, Watertown, the ranch, or Dreamland. He was found dead of a heart attack a year after our last meeting.

00;18;38;25 - 00;19;02;20
Unknown
The second individual, Sal, worked directly with the National Security Agency with electronics intelligence and became a defense contractor. Upon his retirement, Sal worked for the company that created the TR three B gravity disruption device called the Magnetic Field Disrupter. More on this later. The third friend, doc, was an SR 71 spy plane pilot and USAF test pilot at Edwards Air Force Base.

00;19;02;22 - 00;19;27;23
Unknown
Those who have watched my reverse engineering project at Edwards video will immediately recognize the importance of Edwards and the 412 test group comprising the Edwards Test Pilot School. If you haven't, I recommend watching that, but we'll explain more during future testimony. The fourth friend, Dell, served with Fukushima during Vietnam. Dell's father worked for the NSA for over 25 years and sent for a host of majestic 12 documents.

00;19;27;26 - 00;20;02;23
Unknown
The fifth member, Ran Budd, was a D.O.D. contractor electronics engineer who worked on top secret R&D programs with electronic countermeasures. The men were perturbed by the fact each had been privy to unusual phenomena, extremely advanced technology, and unidentified aerial vehicles that had not been reported. As we sat at a table on a dark corner of the Silver Dollar Saloon in Las Vegas, discussing our experiences and swapping knowledge, each of the group of five assured me that they trusted me enough to write about their secrets and protect them.

00;20;02;25 - 00;20;28;10
Unknown
We agreed to get together the next year with an understanding that I would contact each of them and set up the meeting. In the meantime, I wrote down all of our notes and their input and their contacts from other friends about unusual phenomena and their personal sightings. Many of the things the group revealed to me were startling, even to me, who had worked 25 years on black programs.

00;20;28;13 - 00;20;52;02
Unknown
But before we continue, let's walk things back and get to know Fu Shaye and his station in black programs a little bit better. In 1979, after working at Nellis with top secret Crypto Access clearance, Fu, Shaye received a request for temporary reassignment to a place with No Name. Russia's commanding officer had no idea where he was going, who he would be working with, or what he would be working on.

00;20;52;05 - 00;21;22;25
Unknown
And while we're here, let's take a longer look at this document obtained via FOIA, discussing a promotional recommendation for fuchsia. Fuchsia was assigned to detachment three, a FTC, which is the Air Force Flight Test Center detachment from Edwards Air Force Base that runs operations at area 51, Graham Lake. Remember how witness Ed stated he was read into UAP programs at Nellis and Area 51 S4, before moving on to become a test director of Reverse Engineered Craft at Edwards.

00;21;22;28 - 00;21;44;23
Unknown
Edgar left on a Monday morning at 4:30 a.m. and boarded a dark blue USAF bus with blacked out windows. 28 other people sat on the bus, not including two security policemen, but all personnel were ordered not to speak to one another. After several hours, the bus came to rest and Fucci knew immediately where he was. Groom Lake Area 51.

00;21;44;29 - 00;22;11;24
Unknown
According to the Master Sergeant, the top secret SR 75, SR 74 and TR3 b operated out of Groom Lake and have historically been misidentified as UFOs. Upon reaching Groom Lake, the bus entered a hangar and the doors were shut. Security personnel checked in for Shay and the others. He was given a pair of heavy glasses, similar to welder's goggles that obscured his peripheral vision and restricted vision to within 30ft.

00;22;11;26 - 00;22;36;28
Unknown
For the next ten consecutive days and further on, follow up visits through Shay's routine was the same leave Nellis before sunrise and return to Nellis after dark. Fucci would write down everything he saw and heard at Groom Lake, including hearing topics discussed such as pulse detonation, cyclotron radiation, quantum flux transduction, field generators, quasi crystal energy lenses, and EPR quantum receivers.

00;22;37;00 - 00;23;02;13
Unknown
Pulse detonation may remind you of the Aurora pulsar craft scene by Brad Sorenson at the 1988 Norton Air Force Base Show. I'm not going to talk about quasicrystals. I'll make a prediction. Quasi crystals is the key to everything you want to ever know. Well, how they got here. That's all I'm going to say about it now. Except one of the quasi crystals is the hydrogen crystal.

00;23;02;19 - 00;23;29;28
Unknown
His station at Groom Lake is also where Fucci would meet treat aka men in Black. Agent Gerald, according to fuchsia on area 51, is the super secret laboratory named the Defense Advanced Research Center, of which we can only find one official mention. Daas consists of ten underground stories next to a mountain near Papoose Lake, south of Groom Lake, and is nestled next to a hangar in the side of a mountain which stores the TR3 b reverse engineered craft.

00;23;30;06 - 00;23;58;11
Unknown
The Darcy's objectives were fully realized in the mid 1980s, according to fuchsia, when it was bolstered with SDI money under the Reagan administration. Viewers of my channel will recall multiple times in which I have discussed sources commenting on the Strategic Defense Initiative SDI under Reagan, serving a secondary purpose to protect the US mainland from ballistic missiles, this secondary purpose being the detection of an offensive capabilities against UAP.

00;23;58;15 - 00;24;23;23
Unknown
Fushi claimed his sources estimated up to 35% of SDI funding was siphoned off to support USAF black programs starting in 1982. Firsthand RV witness Brad Sorensen was additionally told in 1988 by the men in charge of the RV exhibit they were requesting funding to build more of these reverse engineered craft. The Reagan Admin placed extreme importance on the building of a RVs.

00;24;23;25 - 00;25;07;10

Shockingly, she stated, defense contractor e.g. not only provided classified R&D for black projects, technical and scientific support for nuclear and energy R&D, but also e.g. built these hidden bunkers, mountain hangars and vast underground facilities at Groom Lake, Papoose and Mercury for the government housing facilities such as Daas. The mention of these facilities ties into the topic of domes, deep underground military bases which I will explore in the future alongside e.g. the Rand Corporation, more than likely as a hand here, Edgar would also claim he gathered knowledge, e.g. and was awarded an indefinite contract for project Red light to support the department of Energy and Military.

00;25;07;14 - 00;25;36;07
Unknown
This contract gave them responsibility to assist in the recovery of nuclear materials, in cases of mishaps, and to provide aerial and ground security for highly classified government and military sites. One's mine may be drawn here to the Nuclear Emergency Support Team supported by AEG, but project Red light was also relayed to Leonard Stringfield in his crash retrieval status reports by a witness claiming the project served to test Nye and reverse engineered craft on the Nellis Test Range.

00;25;36;07 - 00;26;01;01
Unknown
After the craft had been shipped from Edwards Air Force Base. Sources of the Master Sergeant claimed. As of 1992, the Air Force conducted a contingency plan. Due to so many public eyes on area 51, this would see the majority of exotic aircraft platforms relocated to Utah, likely Dugway Proving Grounds, Colorado, Alaska, Greenland, Diego Garcia and south of area 51 to S-4.

00;26;01;03 - 00;26;18;25

But it papoose where they store one of the 2 or 3 B's and they maintain this as their depot. It's built in the side of a mountain cut out of stone. They have a holographic generator that generates the side of the mountain, and when you're ten feet from the side of this mountain and looking into the hangar, you can all see a mountain.

00;26;18;27 - 00;26;41;27
Unknown
And that's why when the Russian satellites fly over to verify the Salt treaty, when there are infrared and other spectral scanners shoot down at groom, they only see stone, because that's all that's there just before this date of 1992. There is, strangely enough, evidence to show a heavy focus on strange, exotic aircraft programs out of area 51, possibly UFO related.

00;26;41;29 - 00;27;08;14

In 1990, Jane's Defense writer James Goodall revealed a thesis of at least eight black programs flying out of area 51 Groom Lake, including a silent triangle utilizing unconventional technologies. A source Goodall knew for 12 years was stationed at Groom Lake and explained that UAP positively exist at the base, while another source of his stated quote, we have things out there that are literally out of this world better than Star Trekker.

Anything you can see in the movies. End quote. And now we finally get into a full bodied description of the TR3 b craft.

00;27;21;01 - 00;27;56;22
Unknown
Finally, I've saved the best for last. The operation model of the TR3. B friend of mine said he had never forget the sight of the alien looking TR3 b landing that papoose south of groom. The pitch black, triangular shaped TR3 b is rarely mentioned and then only in whispers. This craft the most classified aerospace development program in existence at the time, codename Astra advanced stealth technology reconnaissance aircraft, saw 200ft diameter testing models in three and 600ft diameter.

00;27;56;22 - 00;28;23;16
Unknown
Operational models. The Tactical Reconnaissance TR three B operated as the most exotic model under the Aurora program, according to the same program umbrella that oversaw the pulsed detonation UAV pulsar craft observed by Brad Sorenson, and we may have some clues regarding this family of aurora craft in previous DoD budgets. In DoD procurement programs, we can find an Aurora project.

00;28;23;16 - 00;28;52;16
Unknown
The DoD planned to spend $80 million on in fiscal year 86 and $2.3 billion on in fiscal year 87. This 25 times increase in spending is enormous, and at the time was double the cost of the B-2 spirit bomber program. The Aurora program may have included the reverse engineered TR three B Lockheed Pulsar as seen by Sorensen, and a little known craft titled the SR 33 A, introduced by Doctor Michael Wolff.

00;28;52;23 - 00;29;38;13
Unknown
An alleged UAP consultant to the National Security Council special subcommittee. Similar to TR3, B, and pulsar, the SR 33 A allegedly utilized conventional fuel and anti-gravity field propulsion systems to operate under a secret space program. The first flight ready operational model of TR three B occurred in the early 1990s, built through SDI and black budget monies. By 1994, at least three of the billion dollar plus operational models were flying, but few had seen the prototype model or a different model three times previously, far before 1994, and according to his sources, there were numerous prototypes, with the first anti-gravity warping craft flying in the early 1970s.

00;29;38;15 - 00;30;01;11
Unknown
Not only did he claim to have seen photographs of TR3, b from a C-130 flying mission support for the reverse engineered craft, but she also claimed to have observed the triangles one night in 1975, high in the atmosphere over Edwards Air Force Base, as well as 1976 within the southern part of Nellis Range, and lastly in 1979 at Groom Lake.

00;30;01;14 - 00;30;30;03
Unknown
This prototype model looked fairly similar to Shay's official model, but with different engines on the tip and no road crew compartment. I do recommend checking out part six of author Andrew Johnson's interviews with fuchsia to hear more about his sightings. For the interest of time, I will not show these long clips here, but let's hear about more aspects of the TR three B for Shay learned from sources within black programs and his five disclosure comrades, and then discuss how the propulsion and engineering system allegedly functioned.

00;30;30;06 - 00;31;01;20
Unknown
According to these sources, the original TR three B craft design was reverse engineered by Sandia National Labs in Livermore Laboratories from a non-human intelligence crash recovery from an unknown date or location, Sandia may be familiar to some as a laboratory nestled within Kirtland Air Force Base. New Mexico has been often historically implicated with UFO material recovery seen. Numerous mentions within the 12 documents, such as the Eisenhower Briefing Document and Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit Reports.

00;31;01;23 - 00;31;55;13
Unknown
Livermore Labs, now called Lawrence Livermore, is one of three national security enterprise for DC's federally funded research and development centers, sponsored by the DoD to support U.S. nuclear deterrence. The other two locations are Los Alamos National Labs and, of course, Sandia. I myself have been told alongside other CS University affiliated research centers for RCS are semi-private institutions that serve to operate alongside DoD and corporate legacy programs for material exploitation, reverse engineering, etc. other FFR ADCs include Oak Ridge National Laboratory, owned by Battelle, where our good friend Sean Kirkpatrick ran off to after arrow, as well as numerous institutions run by the Miter Corporation and Rand Corporation, Miter and Rand will receive their own projects in

00;31;55;13 - 00;32;22;12
Unknown
the near future, as I believe these semi-private institutions are integral corporations involved in legacy programs. Those unfamiliar with UAC just need to look back at my work on the 1965 Kecksburg crash. Doctor Eric Walker, president of Penn State Self, admitted he oversaw the Kecksburg crash site. Walker had also previously set up Penn State's UAC, the applied research laboratory, at the behest of the US Navy.

00;32;22;14 - 00;32;52;08
Unknown
And let's not forget, as of 2024, the untrustworthy arrow under new leadership of Doctor Kozlowski, admitted arrow, a likely whistleblower honeypot with contract with Sand Corp., a company built to prevent whistleblower leaks, stated arrow works alongside UAC and FFR, DC. Sure, right now most of our collaborations that are veering towards academia are with your university affiliated research centers associated with universities or with FFR docs.

00;32;52;11 - 00;33;16;28
Unknown
All this is to say, for Shea's accusations that Sandia and Lawrence reverse engineered NHC craft is a sober and rational statement. Edgar would also state the TR3 B program was managed by the NRO, CIA, and NSA, and the craft was built primarily by Lockheed, Boeing, Northrop, Teledyne, Ryan, and a number of other defense contractors to keep R&D compartmentalized.

00;33;17;00 - 00;33;45;16
Unknown
There is a lot to break down here, one due to the excellent work of Chris Sharp and an upcoming interview that I have with Doctor Eric Davis. Yes, of the Wilson Davis memo, we can implicate the CIA Directorate of Science and Technology with support agencies such as the National Reconnaissance Office, National Underwater Reconnaissance Office, National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, and likely the National Security Agency as leading teams behind UFO crash retrievals.

00;33;45;20 - 00;34;16;26

Fuchsia mentioning Lockheed Martin needs no further explanation. I do recommend checking out both my Marc McCandless video and Lockheed Martin investigation. Find them in the video description. Now, Boeing is indeed an interesting mentioned director of Edwards for 12th Electronic Warfare Group. Ed stated he worked alongside Boeing and Lockheed on reverse engineered craft systems at the Nellis range. Boeing will additionally receive a video of its own, but for now, let's reference a fascinating 2013 project by stealth aircraft researcher John Joseph.

00;34;17;03 - 00;34;44;28
Unknown
Joseph claims Boeing served as the primary contractor in Project Brilliant, an SDI program with the goal of setting up an electromagnetic shield around the US using a boomerang shaped craft that could loiter over cities. Northrop Grumman has as much as Lockheed Martin been historically implicated with the creation of TR3. B let us hold off on discussing them for now, as later I would like to tackle a possible triangle variant constructed by Northrop Grumman.

00;34;45;00 - 00;35;18;19
Unknown
Fushi new. The TR3 b housed a crew of four and served as logistics support and transport for a secret space Command. These pilots were top graduates of Navy and USAF test pilot schools, mainly out of the Edwards for 12th Test School. Edwards witness Ed addition made these same claims. The craft employed two nuclear reactors, was comprised of advanced composites, metal materials and titanium, and employed variable vectored intake and thrusters on the edges and advanced multi-mode propulsion engines on each tip of the triangle.

00;35;18;23 - 00;35;44;29
Unknown
The triangle has three lights on each tip, a large diffuse light on the bottom center. Due to the MFD drive and featured almost no sound bar, a magnetic hum in the TR three B outer coating was reactive to electrical radar stimulation and can change reflectiveness radar absorption. Fushi described the outer skin panels as electro chromatic, which would camouflage the craft for daytime stealth operations.

00;35;45;01 - 00;36;09;02
Unknown
But let's further dive into the propulsion system from Edgar's own words, the circular plasmon field accelerated rain, called a magnetic field disrupter surrounds or rotatable crew compartment. It's far ahead of anything you've ever imagined as far as technology. Sandia and Livermore Laboratories developed a reverse engineered MFD, and I believe the government will go to any lengths to protect this technology.

00;36;09;04 - 00;36;43;21
Unknown
But you're not going to be able to build one of these from what I tell you. Nor am I so the government will go to any leaks believing the plasma and this accelerator's mercury based. It's pressurized a 250,000 atmospheres at a temperature of 150 degrees Kelvin. Superconductivity and accelerated to 60,000 revolutions per minute to create a superconductive plasma with the resulting gravity energy, the MFD generates a magnetic vortex field, which disrupts and neutralizes the effects of gravity on Mars within proximity.

00;36;43;21 - 00;37;14;21
Unknown
By 89%. Do not misunderstand. This is not anti-gravity. Anti-Gravity you can use as a propulsive force the mass of the circular accelerator and all the mass within the accelerator, such as a crew compartment. Avionics, MFD systems, fuels, environmental systems and nuclear reactor are reduced by 89%. This causes the effect to make the aircraft extremely light and able to outperform any aircraft yet constructed.

00;37;14;23 - 00;37;46;00
Unknown
Except, of course, those we didn't build. TR3 B is a high altitude stealth reconnaissance platform with indefinite loiter time. Once you get it up, there at speed, it doesn't take much propulsion propulsion to maintain altitude, but the vehicle's mass reduced by 89%. The vehicle can travel at Mach nine vertically or horizontally. So for those that have had sightings of things making light and they're not perfect right turns, obviously nothing can make a perfect right turn.

00;37;46;03 - 00;38;15;25
Unknown
It's against the laws of physics. But it sure looks like a right turn at a distance. For those that have seen it, that's how they do it. Here are three B is uses three multi-mode thrusters mounted on each corner of the triangular platform. The multi-mode propulsion system can operate in the atmosphere with thrust provided by the nuclear reactor and in the upper atmosphere with hydrogen propulsion and an orbit with combined hydrogen oxygen propulsion, a key component of TR three B propulsion.

00;38;15;25 - 00;38;44;28
Unknown
As described by future states, it's MFD technology built from reverse engineered UAP is not anti-gravity necessarily. Anti-Gravity, by definition, provides a propulsive force that can be used for propulsion. MFD creates a quote unquote, disruption of the Earth's gravitational field upon the mass within the circular accelerator. Such systems leverage from non-human technology may indeed be present and highly secret, but acknowledged to aircraft systems.

00;38;45;02 - 00;39;08;28
Unknown
One such example may be the Northrop Grumman B-2 stealth bomber. UFO researchers such as Doctor Richard Boylan have reported three star generals, and retired USAF Colonel Donald Wear have disclosed the B-2 carries on board electric rivet systems to cause internal mass reduction on the wings and fuselage of the craft, which directly leads to the over $1 billion price tag for each craft.

00;39;09;00 - 00;39;32;29
Unknown
The question is, and Mark talked about this before, is there more going on to the B-2 than meets the eye? Aviation Week Space Technology March 9th, 1992 had a very interesting article. Article from people who worked at Northrop who were very upset that the technology associated with the B-2 program was not being trickled down to the public industry.

00;39;32;29 - 00;39;57;22
Unknown
They talk about how the B-2 electrically charges the leading edge of the wing to reduce the radar cross signature. That's what you see in this diagram right here. And then negatively charges the exhaust gases to reduce the infrared signature. This is the same type of electro gravity technology that T Townsend Brown had originally proposed in the 1930s. So this technology might date back a lot earlier than we originally thought.

00;39;57;24 - 00;40;33;13
Unknown
And before we move on, remember earlier when Edgar Fucci mentioned Astro Advanced stealth technology reconnaissance aircraft served as the codename for TR3? B well, we may in fact have a crash retrieval of this craft in Ryan Wood's masterpiece Magic Eyes. Only we can find a case dated September 26th, 1994 from Boscombe Down, England. This case file reference is a publication from the November 1994 edition of Air Force Monthly, which discusses an unusual crash landing on the runway of the UK government's highly secret Boscombe Down facility.

00;40;33;16 - 00;40;59;24
Unknown
Rumors quickly circulated the crash was of a flying triangle seen by UFO witnesses for decades. The Air Force Monthly article reads. Quote. Shortly after the crash, an unmarked civilian registered CIA operated Boeing 737, in a similarly anonymous DC eight visited, and two days later the wreck was loaded onto a CC five Galaxy and flown to Air Force Plant 42 at Palmdale, California.

00;41;00;03 - 00;41;38;15
Unknown
The secrecy surrounding the incident has led to speculation that the aircraft involved was a TR3, a the existence of which the US government has yet to officially acknowledge and quote. While this publication mentions the crash of a TR3, A and fuchsia does indeed state the TR3 a exist, but is remarkably different from TR3. B it's worth noting quite often in the public realm, TR3 A and tr3 b are often used almost interchangeably, so perhaps this crash case is referencing TR3 b and this distinction is key to explore further, as terminology around TR3 eight is quite confusing.

00;41;38;17 - 00;42;10;01
Unknown
Quite often I have seen the TR3 referred to as the pumpkin seed, a craft utilizing pulsed detonation engines. The same unmanned craft Brad Sorenson saw in 1988, while other sources refer to TR3 a as a delta shaped fighter featuring a cockpit, pulse detonation engines and electric rivet for internal mass reduction or complementary field propulsion for high speeds. But while exploring this A and B distinction under codename Astra, there is a fascinating tangent I want to cover.

00;42;10;04 - 00;42;41;26
Unknown
Let's reference Secret Machines by Tom DeLonge and AJ Hartley, an extremely famous science fiction novel in the UFO community that fuzes the imagination of DeLonge with actual events obtained from U.S. military and government sources. A literary device known as a romana clay. Facts in this book were allegedly given to DeLonge by advisers such as the commander of the Air Force Research Lab at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, multiple Lockheed Martin skunkworks officials such as Eric Schrock and others.

00;42;41;29 - 00;43;12;15
Unknown
This excellent book makes numerous mentions to an astro black triangle reverse engineered craft quote. The craft itself, according to its data manual, was triangular and was named the Astra three B, but we just call it the Locust, said Beaker with a smile. He was proud to be connected to it. The locust had control layouts unlike those used in any aircraft he had ever seen, controls that were not just familiar, but counterintuitive to anyone with a basic sense of aviation or aerospace physics.

00;43;12;15 - 00;43;38;02
Unknown
End quote. But what I really want to draw attention to here is the description of the Astra's control mechanism. When characters in the film operate the Astra Tier three B locust, the pilot's chair looked disappointingly like that from an F-16, but on the left arm, rest of the pilot's seat sat a red sphere sitting in the cradle. Quote Alan turned the sphere under his hand and the craft rotated cleanly, too cleanly in the air.

00;43;38;05 - 00;43;58;20
Unknown
He then applied a little thrust and was moving the landmarks of Paris, including the Eiffel Tower, zipping past them in a blur, he pursed his lips. State of the art, it may be, but it didn't feel like flight. No aircraft could pivot on a dime like he had just done. And quote unquote, he engaged the manual system and cupped his hand over the red trackball on his arm rest.

00;43;58;22 - 00;44;21;06
Unknown
He rolled it gently, and the locust pivoted in place. He engaged the manual system and cupped his hand over the red trackball on the armrest. He rolled it gently, and the locust pivoted in place. He did it again, applying a little thrust with his other hand, and the ship changed direction again, leaping hard to the west and then climbing in a dizzying spiral before screaming back to the southeast.

00;44;21;13 - 00;44;43;01
Unknown
Of course, there was no screaming, except perhaps inside Allen's head, as the laws of physics seemed to implode with each movement, the craft made no sound, no torque, no G-Force, no inertia. End quote. Now, of course, this passage material is interesting, but why do I bring this up? Well, because the control scheme in this is the exact same sphere mechanism.

00;44;43;01 - 00;45;12;11
Unknown
Primary witness Brad Sorensen and aerospace illustrator Mark McCandless claims the alien reproduction vehicle flux liners utilize it. See on screen, Mark McCandless is drawing of the trackball used to control the flying saucer. Countless comparisons to the 1988 saucer RV encounter have been made so far in this project. Perhaps the flux liner and TR3 b are born of the same programs.

00;45;12;14 - 00;45;37;09
Unknown
With disclosures as impactful and spellbinding as Fu Shays, his story attracted a great deal of attention and controversy. So I'd briefly like to mention the contentious arguments that waged war against Russia in the early and mid 20 tens. This controversy is quite complex, and I have zero skin in this game, so we will simply try and analyze the statements made criticizing and supporting Russia and the story of the TR3 be.

00;45;37;12 - 00;46;19;27
Unknown
Let us draw out a few key players here. Jeremy Rice, aka Alien scientist David Hamilton, author of Secret Space Program, Andrew Johnson, UFO researcher Dan Benkert, and Master Sergeant Boucher himself on his website, alien scientist.com Jeremy Ries posted some startling opinions on Russia after discussing Edgar's autobiography and very real military documents. Jeremy stated the TR three B testimony was, quote, information that has no technical value and was likely fabricated by Ed in an effort to combine stories about the Nazi bell device with the Belgian wave of triangular UFO sightings so that his story would be more believable to the UFO research community and quote.

00;46;20;00 - 00;46;45;25
Unknown
This claim was based off criticism of Ed, stating the TR3 beat utilized mercury based plasma systems alongside strong opinions. After years of friendship with the Master Sergeant. After meeting Edgar in 2009, Jeremy would view the veteran as a close friend and legitimate whistleblower for years. Quote. After having known Edgar Fucci for the past four years, I must say that he is one of the most deceitful and manipulative people that I have ever met personally.

00;46;45;25 - 00;47;23;07
Unknown
And quote Jeremy would accuse this behavior as stemming from PTSD driven rampant alcoholism. Jeremy would even state Edgar claim to have flown a tier 3B1 night whilst intoxicated. However, he provides no evidence or receipts of this statement. Author Andrew Johnson, who conducted numerous interviews with Fucci and formed a close friendship, on the contrary, spoke very highly of the man positions against Edgar from Jeremy Ries and an individual known as David Hamilton Crutch on a few key points outside of what Jeremy viewed as a lack of compelling physics behind the TR3, b faked military documents and a photo of the F-117 stealth fighter.

00;47;23;10 - 00;47;53;10
Unknown
On an undisclosed date, Edgar sent Jeremy an image alleging to picture Fucci alongside a crew observing the F-117 prototype at area 51 between 1977 and 1981, Ries claimed Ed stole the photo from an article titled F-117 A Senior Trend. The photographer of this image would even respond, quote, I cannot tell you who is in that photo, but I can tell you that Mr. Fucci doesn't know what he is talking about and quote, my issue here is actually Jeremy's initial emails to the photographer.

00;47;53;10 - 00;48;15;26
Unknown
Dan alien scientist's email was overwhelmingly charged with leading statements against Edgar providing links to his full disclosures on TR3. B while stating, quote, Ed has constructed a series of lies around this picture. Being and stationed at Groom Lake. Many of us do not believe Ed at all and quote, this is not how one elicits an unbiased and objective response.

00;48;15;29 - 00;48;42;20
Unknown
In 2013, YouTuber David Hilton posted a video titled Edgar Fucci Fake Documents, which saw subsequent videos posted by Jeremy. It is worth noting both of these projects have been unlisted and removed from YouTube. Whether this is due to walking back the statements or to prevent further controversy, I am not sure. Hilton constructed a group email with Jeremy Ries, Dan B and Andrew Johnson, author of Secret Program and supporter of Fucci.

00;48;42;21 - 00;49;05;03
Unknown
After a series of extensive interviews with The witness to discuss the video allegedly exposing Touch√©, Hilton stated quote, after knowing Ed on a personal level since February of 2012, it is my opinion that he made up, lied about everything. I've caught him in so many lies and contradictions that I can't keep up with them all. It's not really something that can be completely hashed out in an email and quote.

00;49;05;08 - 00;49;30;01
Unknown
This statement is rather shocking to me as alongside historical documents provided by Fucci, numerous documents highlighting Fischer's military service were pried from for you by Hilton himself. While we cannot view this video or further context of Hilton claiming Fucci is a liar, we can analyze Edgar's response on the outposts forum in July of 2014. Here, Edgar addressed the points Hilton seemingly made in his video by his response.

00;49;30;01 - 00;49;56;03
Unknown
In defense of the documents, it appears Hilton attempted to address only small inconsistencies within the documents, such as small indents, versions, variable pressure on letters, physical degradation of source documents and copies. Due to Hilton and Rice retracting their video. I must conclude they conceded these claims against fuchsia. Hilton additionally made some startling comments to the aforementioned Danby in a June 2012 Skype conversation.

00;49;56;07 - 00;50;18;05
Unknown
Now, Danby is not to be confused with Dan Parrish. This is UFO researcher Dan Benkert, who has coauthored excellent work with Michael Sharratt. Benkert has been a staunch supporter of Fucci after knowing him personally, and once offered a fascinating and worthy counter explanation to a March 19th, 2016 article titled Edgar through chaise TR3. B is most likely a hoax.

00;50;18;10 - 00;50;43;24
Unknown
Anyway, speaking to Danby, Hilton would make some extremely startling remarks, such as quote, actually, I work for an agency that monitors things you shouldn't do. Go ahead and tell people they won't believe you. End quote and quote I now control Ed, not you. Funny how things work out, isn't it? The exposure becomes a tool of control. End quote.

Historically, accounts of witnessing Nietzsche craft or Nietzsche crash retrievals contained uniform elements. These craft and technologies of unknown origin seem almost perfect. No seams, no rivets, no bolts, almost as if the craft are 3D printed. Some of these craft feature entirely smooth bodies are what humans would describe as windows, yet some of the craft often appear beautiful and perfect in appearance.

This is almost never seen in triangular craft sightings. Let us analyze some of these cases. They've been seen almost in every country by every possible culture. So it's a worldwide phenomenon. We've got a case, over here of a red one with this exhaust port here. We've got a case in Detroit, we've got Belgium cases. So a brief cross section of this aircraft have been seen all around the world.

The primary features of these triangles, they usually have a white light on the corner of each of the triangle. Some of these are between 200 and 300ft across. This midsection is generally about 20ft across. And then there's always this interesting structural work on the bottom, and probably a red or amber light in the center of the bottom section of the craft.

00;52;00;23 - 00;52;23;18
Unknown
That's kind of the overall view of what we see here. Let's travel back to October 28th, 1993, to Croton Falls, New York, in the midst of the Hudson Valley UFO flap and analyze the testimony of Jim Cook. A cook, a biomedical engineer, was driving to his Hudson River Valley home when he encountered a truly bizarre craft near the Croton Falls Reservoir.

00;52;23;18 - 00;52;45;19
Unknown
Cook spotted aircraft lights approached the water level, dropping very fast. The lights appeared to hover before blinking out. Cook, walking out of his car to the shoreline, spotted a triangular object hovering 200ft away, 15ft above the water. Nine red lights appeared on the triangle side, and a red brake of light from the underside began to probe the water.

00;52;45;21 - 00;53;16;21

Now let's move to the year 2000. In the town of Saint Clair in southern Illinois, where numerous small town residents and police officers reported a triangular shaped craft. In the early morning of January 5th, police officers reported a UFO near Scott Air Force Base. The craft was massive and elongated black triangle, roughly 75ft long and 40ft wide. At each corner sat a bright white light under waving and luminosity, one smaller flashing red lights at just below the object's midline.

00;53;16;21 - 00;53;41;00
Unknown
Near the rear two lights. The back of the object appeared rectangular and illuminated in white light through the middle of the light, running lengthwise was a band of multicolored illumination. It was stated there were no individual colored lights visible. Rather, it appeared as a band of various colors which blended into each other. A second police officer reported the object heading in a westerly direction, matching the description of initial reports.

00;53;41;03 - 00;54;17;22
Unknown
This officer, Martin, added he believed the object to be maybe 75 to 100 yards in width, at an altitude of 1000ft. The object was estimated to travel at a loitering speed of 15mph before accelerating to a 100mph. Let's also jump to Madison, Wisconsin on November 22nd, 1985, where multiple eyewitnesses described a triangular doll roughly 40ft across craft. Excellent researcher Michael Schrag extracted a quote from one of the eyewitnesses, who stated the underside of the craft resembled, quote, the back of a refrigerator, like a collection of condensation pipes that ran back and forth.

00;54;17;22 - 00;54;45;03
Unknown
End quote. One can't help but wonder here if this craft scene was an alien reproduction triangle utilizing prototype propulsion systems requiring a massive heat exchanger apparatus. Similar oddities can be observed in the United Kingdom's infamous sighting by Colin Saunders. In March of 1999, Saunders and his family, upon driving home from dinner, observed a 50ft long, triangular shaped craft that pitched up and down at roughly a 15 degree angle.

00;54;45;09 - 00;55;09;09
Unknown
Colin claimed the craft bobbed as if it were submerged in water. The exterior of the craft was described as a flowing liquid mercury, which reminds me closely of Lance Corporal Jonathan Wiggins UFO crash retrieval case, in which Wiggins observed a crashed UAP with skin, described as the mother of pearl effect. The top of the craft was not flat, but more angled, with a strange raised pattern on top.

00;55;09;09 - 00;55;36;18
Unknown
Saunders, believed to be some sort of docking mechanism with a larger craft and this same pattern existed on the underside of the craft. Parasitic aircraft are not uncommon in human made airplanes. In fact, in the 1970s, Yusuf proposed a Boeing 747 airborne aircraft carrier to house an array of fighter jets. This sloping top also sounds very dissimilar from the TR3 B, but may sound extremely similar to the craft we're about to discuss.

00;55;36;24 - 00;56;04;01

Analyzing the strange lights, fixtures, systems, and appearances of these triangles seen throughout the 1980s to early 2000. We must ask, were these craft human made? Were they prototypes or iterations of TR3? B or were these all the result of separate legacy programs, or were these flying triangles somewhere in between?

00;56;04;03 - 00;56;24;25

This is a photo of a UFO that reportedly crashed in Roswell, New Mexico in 1947. Now, I know you don't believe that story, but just hear me out now. Ellens Air Base, the same base that we're at right now. The same base that, for some strange reason, doesn't appear on your U.S. government map, is supposedly one of the six sites where parts from the wreckage were shipped.

00;56;24;26 - 00;56;57;07
Unknown
Mulder, I you suggesting that the military is flying UFOs? No. Planes built using UFO technology. Fascinating lines of research, fully independent of who Sheas TR3 be leads to a very similar reverse engineer triangular craft known by disgruntled engineers as the XF 131 Super Sentinel. Let's visit respected artist Bill MacDonald, an old school freelance commercial illustrator, concept designer, forensic reconstruction illustrator, and current sworn law enforcement professional.

00;56;57;11 - 00;57;25;16
Unknown
I have featured MacDonald's work in multiple projects, most notably his designs with Doctor Robert Wood of the extraterrestrial entities known as EB one and EB two, described within the majestic 12 Special Operations Manual, as well as his fantastic work on the Roswell craft and the 1976 Tehran, Iran UFO incident, McDonald additionally featured in a fantastic four part series on Michael Schwartz YouTube channel titled Roswell Revisited.

00;57;25;19 - 00;57;50;16
Unknown
I myself have had the pleasure of speaking with Mr. McDonald and hold an extremely high opinion of him, including speaking on the drawing in case we are about to discuss. And here I present to you the beautiful piece titled Tehachapi Triangle. 1992. McDonald met with four old engineers at a Denny's in Antelope Valley, California, in the spring of 1992.

00;57;50;19 - 00;58;15;29
Unknown
All four engineers, two from Northrop Grumman and two from Lockheed Martin, were fed up with egregious security impositions, negatively impacting their lives. All four engineers were subject to extreme project compartmentalization, with each having a piece of the puzzle for the name of the triangular craft antelope Valley residents had been reporting for numerous years, the XF 131 Super Sentinel.

00;58;16;01 - 00;58;42;15
Unknown
Each of these engineers wanted their story told without threats to their lives, jail time, or stripping of pensions. Does this sound familiar to anybody about the current state of UAP whistleblowers? The four men had found each other over a number of decades while being employed at various facilities surrounding the California High Desert. The two Northrop employees hailed from a facility called Tahan or Tehachapi Ranch by UFO researchers.

00;58;42;15 - 00;59;05;21
Unknown
McDonald claims he was able to confirm this testimony through friends of his father and his father's mentor, Robert Scandrick, who worked for Roswell International Strategic Systems Division. The other two claimed to work for Ben Rich at Lockheed Skunk Works in Glendale, California, and worked the radar cross-section range known as Hallandale. First off, let's quickly recall the similarity to TR3.

00;59;05;21 - 00;59;35;02
Unknown
B when Fucci asked if Kelly Johnson was the senior project designer for TR3, b he responded, quote, no, it would have been Ben Rich and quote. Second, the Hallandale facility located very closely to Edwards Air Force Base in Palmdale, USAF plant 42, two locations I have directly accused of housing reverse engineering programs would later be accused by Steven Greer and others as a currently ongoing black budget deep Sixed UAP reverse engineering location.

00;59;35;04 - 01;00;04;00
Unknown
Now, interestingly, the Senate Intelligence and Armed Services Committee and other senior officials had no idea of this. The top people and the Special forces who are outside this illegal black project system didn't know about it. I had known about it since the 90s, but I'd never flown directly over it because it's classified airspace and very sensitive. So, you can see what looks like a trough and a runway.

01;00;04;03 - 01;00;27;29
Unknown
It's just where the manmade UFOs that we've been building since the 1954 55 come out. They go up and they hover. They're silent. They're electro gravity, anti-gravity. The demon on the left, you see that? It looks like a runway with a diamond. It's not a runway because they don't need to run and get. There's not an aerodynamic. They just go boom up, but they're placed on different diamonds.

01;00;28;01 - 01;00;57;29
Unknown
I have a whole series of video and pictures of these who don't have time to go through, and that's where they're put at various elevations and then struck with an electromagnetic weapon to see if it's hardened enough, to withstand conflict. Right. Five years before Greer would first label the Lockheed Martin Hillandale plant as a program location, McDonald stated the location was designed to be hidden in plain sight, utilizing the cover of a radar cross-section facility.

01;00;57;29 - 01;01;27;29
Unknown
The location's exterior features a storm drainage, flood control channel, which allegedly truly serves as a short runway or platform for the testing of these craft. And here is where things get very, very, very interesting. As I mentioned earlier, I have spoken to McDonald about the XF 131, and he maintains the four engineers were indeed delivering true testimony. I even asked for the individuals identities or leads on the case, so I might contact and interview them myself.

01;01;27;29 - 01;01;54;07
Unknown
He has sworn to protect their identities in the Tehachapi Triangle drawing, McDonald exclaimed. If Ewers recognized the craft, Fox network contracted McDonald's work and made a computer render of the vehicle for the first regular season episode of the X-Files. In the episode titled Deep Throat. This fantastic episode, probably my favorite of the whole series, follows the main characters investigating the disappearance of a USAF test pilot.

01;01;54;12 - 01;02;32;28
Unknown
A mysterious informant tells one of the lead investigators, Mulder, to stay away from the case, utilizing research and testimony I played at the beginning of this section, Mulder learned that the craft, the Super Sentinel, was a reverse engineered craft from the 1947 Roswell, New Mexico case. Investigating the airfield late at night, a triangular shaped craft darts and hovers over Mulder before rapidly speeding away.

01;02;33;00 - 01;02;42;05
Unknown
Oh.

01;02;42;08 - 01;03;07;10
Unknown
Mulder is then captured by Air Force personnel and given a cocktail to forget about what he saw, but not before he caught a glimpse of the craft in a hangar that.

01;03;07;12 - 01;03;38;16
Unknown
Rumors persist of the X-Files screenwriter Chris Carter mentioning he had been approached by unknown military brass, who asked how he knew so much. However, I can find no credible sources here, but what I can find is reference paranormal writer and 25 year FBI investigator, veteran and inspiration for much of the X-Files John D'Souza. In 2023, D'Souza put out a video on YouTube titled John DeSouza, a 25 year veteran of FBI, John D'Souza is exposing the truth of the UAP invasion.

01;03;38;16 - 01;04;08;09
Unknown
And while I voraciously disagree with the project Blu Beam fake invasion narrative, D'Souza does make some very interesting remarks, directly stating the first season of the X-Files was based off true cases. He investigated. Okay, but the craziest one that, I'm still not supposed to talk about, but I can. I can say that, it was it was featured, in I think it was about the first episode of the X-Files.

01;04;08;09 - 01;04;29;24
Unknown
Or maybe it was the second of the first season. By the way, they they use my stories during the first season of the of the X-Files. And then after that, they went to other they, they no longer used my cases, however, the rest of the X-Files, was was all based on true stories as well.

01;04;29;27 - 01;05;04;00
Unknown
However, I would say the craziest, UFO, the craziest paranormal case was when I was. I was sent to a military base. I mean, I can I can say in general terms, I was sent to a military base. We, we observed, a military base where they had had several disappearances that were that were associated with the appearance of UFOs in the in the area, and they were UFOs that the military base said.

01;05;04;07 - 01;05;28;01
Unknown
The commander said, I don't know what to do with this. I mean, I'm I'm at my wits end and so we went to observe these UFOs that had been coming, that had been coming to this the outskirts of this military base and on a regular basis. And they were filled with light. They were filled with light, almost like they didn't even appear metal anymore.

01;05;28;03 - 01;05;55;08
Unknown
And they would just come, they would come to the edge of this forest. And there were there was a group of people who would just do a regular observance of these things. And so myself and my partner, we went and we were with those people and for some reason, one of the UFOs, picked us out for some reason and came directly at us, came directly at us, and just it appeared to land on us.

01;05;55;10 - 01;06;24;10
Unknown
At some point. All the people ran. Everyone ran, including us. But it appeared to land on us. But then it didn't because it disappeared somehow. And, then, we had we had people from the base who took me in, who took me in, against my will. They took me in and they, interrogated me, as to what my knowledge was of the UFOs, it is endlessly fascinating.

01;06;24;10 - 01;06;52;15
Unknown
Chris Carter of The X-Files specifically contracted McDonald's Tehachapi Triangle, an allegedly real reverse engineered RV, for an episode based on true events. This case is seen further investigation for myself behind the scenes. Hey guys, it's UAP girl. And thank you so much for joining me today into this dive into the flying triangles and alien reproduction vehicles. Guys, I know it's been a while and I want to thank each and every one of you for sticking by me.

01;06;52;18 - 01;07;11;05
Unknown
This November has been one heck of a month with going out to see and do a show on Jesse Michaels, to going to the hearings to go into Seoul. It's been insanely busy, so I appreciate everybody sticking by me. Please look forward to the Jesse Michaels interview or kind of project and the Eric Davis interview, which I think everybody will find fascinating.

01;07;11;05 - 01;07;32;09
Unknown
I'll probably use clips from every single project I do from now on here, coming shortly. So let's kind of break down what we discussed today. I for one, was super excited to take on this project because I think whenever people think of triangular shaped UAP to RV to anything, they associate it with TR three B and a lot of the time people don't really know the full story of Edgar Shay.

01;07;32;11 - 01;07;56;29
Unknown
And kind of the story behind TR 3BI know when getting kind of B-roll and footage and images for this video quite often the ZV 131 Super Sentinel, the TR three A and another craft called the TR three E are often confused for tr three B. Now, the reason I didn't cover tr three E is this is often used as kind of a toy model, based off recovered, based off reverse engineered craft.

01;07;56;29 - 01;08;13;29
Unknown
And I have actually talked to some artists who have drawn this TR three E for those of you kind of listening right now, say, what the heck is he talking about? This is the triangle design that almost has sort of a concave, lines in between the vertexes with kind of fins and great, similar to the TR three B and, smallish dome on top.

01;08;13;29 - 01;08;39;04
Unknown
So maybe we'll visit TR three E at this time. But I didn't see too much, evidence or worthwhile study here. So I know sort of the breakdown of these craft can be quite complex, so let's just go through that real fast. On one hand, we have Ex-F1 31 Super Sentinel, which varies greatly to the TR three B and other triangular designs due to the almost pyramid shape on top that is most similar to the 1999 Kirby England sighting.

01;08;39;06 - 01;09;22;07
Unknown
And on this side we have the Aurora program. Let's just say within Aurora there's codename Astra, which is the TR three B Astra stands for Advanced Stealth Technology Reconnaissance aircraft and the TR and tier three V standing for tactical reconnaissance. The TR three B is the reverse engineered craft that is gravity resistant, with companies such as Sandia, Lawrence Livermore and Lockheed Northrop, spearheaded by CIA, NSA, etc., etc. also in that same Aurora program, possibly is the TR three A, which may use advanced stealth, concepts and advanced concepts such as electric rivet for internal mass reduction or something like pulse detonation engines.

01;09;22;09 - 01;09;41;03
Unknown
But let's remember that this craft is generally considered more prosaic with a cockpit. And so forth. And this may have been what crash at Boscombe Down in 1994. So there's the TR three A, the TR three B, and possibly the TR3. E remember what Fucci said? He said there's a whole host of of craft in the, in the TR the tactical reconnaissance line.

01;09;41;03 - 01;10;08;24
Unknown
Just the same with the strategic reconnaissance, the SR line, you know, there's the SR 71. And she alleged that at least concepts of an SR 74 and 75 were in development while he worked, within the defense world. And so forth. So I almost find the description that Ed gives of Daas and other kind of contractor is almost more interesting than the tier three B itself.

01;10;08;27 - 01;10;30;16
Unknown
For example, looking at his for your price documents, I've seen the FTC, the Air Force flight, test center is really critical for me to be able to analyze this story and start to relay this to other stories or other investigation I've done, you know, him talking about project Red light with e.g., for the Doe while IG and G runs area 51.

01;10;30;16 - 01;10;52;27
Unknown
We can also see that, Sandia and I think it's Lawrence Livermore. We're partners for nest nuclear emergency search teams or something like that, but nasty. So there's all these delicious little tie ins, especially when fuchsia mentions, tree. As we saw, there's one mention, publicly available of treet I could possibly find on this. Could be the Army.

01;10;52;27 - 01;11;12;22
Unknown
Army INS commander, stubble mines version of the Men in Black. But, you know, sticking to the video topic, I don't know enough about the physics of TR3 b to kind of dispute the craft like, Jeremy Ries does. And speaking of that, guys, I'm not looking to get involved in any drama or throw my hat in the ring and defender criticize Russia.

01;11;12;25 - 01;11;37;04
Unknown
I simply thought it important to when you have disclosures as impactful and key as Fu Shays to say, hey, there have been individuals who have, brought up issues with certain things he's done, and I just thought it important to relay those and kind of, throw in my opinion, of what I thought about some of the criticisms, I'm not really trying to get involved or squabble with any of the players still active.

01;11;37;09 - 01;11;59;25
Unknown
So just know that, I do that in good faith by just kind of talking about the, the arguments. So tier three B Ex-F1 31 Super Sentinel TR3, b there's 200ft test models and 600ft operational models. The description of the craft down to the diffuser red light on the bottom is a very similar to what numerous people have relayed seen.

01;11;59;25 - 01;12;18;09
Unknown
I mean, I'll scroll through any YouTube video of a triangle sighting, or I'll talk to anybody at jujitsu and they all say that, yeah, I've had a UFO sighting or a my uncle or somebody I know there. They saw a triangle. It had three right white lights and a red one. These sort of sightings seem almost ubiquitous. They seem very common.

01;12;18;09 - 01;12;43;08
Unknown
And then there's something like the XF 131 Super Sentinel, whose size is much smaller, whose underside is, far more intriguing with the, you know, we didn't really dive into the physics or the engineering because that information is unavailable to myself, but with a large light that seems almost, maneuverable on bottom, followed by three pairs of lights kind of on each side of the triangle.

01;12;43;10 - 01;13;03;03
Unknown
I hope everybody enjoyed seeing that. The in X files. I myself am kind of a new X-Files fan, so I've seen that episode and watching Mulder kind of, pursue the subject about the Air Force test pilots who have gone missing just to encounter the triangle, which was reverse engineered from technology at Roswell. This is so intriguing to me.

01;13;03;06 - 01;13;39;26
Unknown
I myself put a lot of weight on both fuchsia and the TR3, B as well as the XF 131 Super Sentinel. I have been and will continue to be investigating that specific craft and that specific story, as it is just extremely, extremely, extremely, extremely intriguing to myself. But I do want to know what everybody thought about TR three B you know, after analyzing the full extent to which Fucci gave testimony, I don't think his story is as simple as a he saw the Belgian UFO wave and he's trying to glom on.

01;13;39;28 - 01;14;03;01
Unknown
I just I don't think it's as simple as that. Now, the most valid criticism of Ed is besides his three sightings, which were not under program operations, he did not work firsthand on the TR three. B much of this information was relayed from Gerald, from Bud, from Doc, from Sal, and so forth. So he is ultimately relaying second hand information.

01;14;03;03 - 01;14;31;28
Unknown
Now, of course, Gerald died pretty soon after their first meeting, but if any of these other gentlemen gentlemen are still around, Fucci is not. He has passed and can share this information. Please reach out to me. Let's kind of let's discuss this a little more because the way I see things right now is that there's likely not one, at least two types of RV that DoD, the Air Force for 12th test Group and legacy programs have.

01;14;32;01 - 01;14;56;19
Unknown
This is something like the flux line or the flying saucer craft that either operates off of electric gravity, magneto hydrodynamics, or zero point energy systems. And then there's something, a little less pretty in the triangles. And these likely operate off of electric or MFD devices and MD devices, as Bouchet talked about. You know, the triangles are not are not capable of what we would assume.

01;14;56;22 - 01;15;18;06
Unknown
II and what we analyze and craft are capable of with the six observable observables. Through Shay. We'll talk about the TR three, be, doing impossible maneuvers right turns that are very close to actual right turns. However, the speed limitations of this craft and so forth, all of these things, the, internal inertial dampening, none of these things are two extreme.

01;15;18;08 - 01;15;41;25
Unknown
And this is one of the things that stuck out to me about the flux liner as well. You know, the F-4 Phantom jump sheet seats, the off the shelf components with this really, interesting reverse engineered or copied propulsion system, the tier three B and the triangles, the, you know, the Ex-F1 31 Super Sentinel two extent seem very similar that it's a human attempt to reproduce something fantastic.

01;15;41;28 - 01;16;07;26
Unknown
Now, what are the nigh triangles? Why, if it's true, did Psalm 101 in 1954 say that these triangles are new and little is known about them? You know, we can start to analyze the the triangle programs in the 80s, 90s, possibly even earlier in the 70s. But, you know, in the 50s, these triangles are they NHC or are they a breakaway civilizations, a precursor to programs?

01;16;07;28 - 01;16;30;18
Unknown
These questions still exist. These questions are super interesting. How many prototypes of TR three B or Ex-F1 31 super similar? Possibly. These triangles are called something else completely that we are none the wiser to. How many prototypes were they? You know, the heat exchangers underneath the pyramid shaped top and Kirby, England, as a docking mechanism. The sightings in southern Illinois is with these interesting strips of lights.

01;16;30;21 - 01;16;54;16
Unknown
The triangles are fascinating, for the area reporting trends of triangles comprising 1 to 4%, you would be astonished at how many people have reported seeing triangle triangular shaped craft. So I'm chewing up a lot of time here, guys. I'm just so excited to be back. I'd like to thank everybody for watching and we are back to our regular regularly scheduled programing.

01;16;54;16 - 01;17;05;05
Unknown
Thank you all so much for joining me into this. Look into Bouchet into TR3, b into flying triangles into RB. I'll catch everybody next time. Thank you so much. Bye.
