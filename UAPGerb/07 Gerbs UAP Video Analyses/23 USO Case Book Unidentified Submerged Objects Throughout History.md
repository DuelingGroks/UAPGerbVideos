The United States most well known UFO investigation panels, Project Sign, Grudge, and Blue Book, ran from 1949 to 1969 and collected data on more than 13,000 UFO sightings of this massive body. Of sightings, 258 cases, reported UFO sightings by ships, and a small percentage of these highlight unidentified submerged objects or trans medium objects. Of course, as I highlighted in my last USO video, go check that out.

00;00;29;05 - 00;00;53;13
Unknown
1952 OP nav directive 3820 restricted Navy UFO sightings to only be shared with Air Force Technical Intelligence Center, USAF intelligence and Director of Naval Intelligence. So it is no wonder we are left wanting for officially reported USO. But what about the cases we do have and what are there cases that don't appear in Bluebook that span our history are worth our time?

00;00;53;15 - 00;01;18;17
Unknown
Hey guys, it's UAP Gerb and join me as we take a closer look at USO sightings throughout history, from Bluebook to the modern day to pre-World War One. Let's analyze reported cases of unidentified submerged objects. And guys, today, we will not just be sticking with the U.S, but analyzing global cases I find worth studying.

00;01;18;19 - 00;01;48;03
Unknown
As mentioned in the intro, only 2% of Bluebook cases aka 258 reports involved see sightings of UFOs, and 13 of these reports can be classified as good meeting merit standards for UFO reporting, and a handful of these cases with relevant data describe USO and trans medium object found in the Annals of Bluebook. Indexing is a sighting that occurred in the North Atlantic from the ship mark Kollar on August 4th, 1950.

00;01;48;05 - 00;02;18;19
Unknown
Shockingly, this case is listed by Bluebook as unidentified and may in fact be my favorite case. I will discuss today at 10 p.m. EDT. The ship master, chief mate and third mate of the M.V. McCullough saw an unidentified elliptical object approach their vessel from the southwest, heading northeast, passing within 1000ft of the ship. The object hovered no more than 100ft above sea level, with speeds ranging from 25 to 500mph.

00;02;18;21 - 00;02;50;24
Unknown
This object was described as modular, cylindrical shaped, and elliptical like half an egg cut lengthwise. The object's appearance varied in testimony from shiny aluminum to metallic white. All three witnesses described the object as having a rotary and wobbling motion as it passed closely over the ocean. This event lasted roughly a minute. We can also hop on board the SS City of El Marco, heading from Yokohama to LA, just north of the Hawaiian Islands, on November 7th, 1959.

00;02;50;27 - 00;03;21;02
Unknown
Three witnesses on board the craft observed a bright object streaking across the water from four miles north of the ship. The light emitted three flashes before submerging under the surface. And remember those three flashes as they'll come up later. The Amoco changed its course to investigate, but nothing was discovered. Bluebook labeled this case as a meteor. But while such a prosaic explanation might be possible, the idea of a meteor taking a low pursuit angle and streaking across the water for an extended time period warrants more investigation.

00;03;21;02 - 00;03;46;18
Unknown
And if that case is not anomalous enough for you, let's investigate. Near the vicinity of Ascension Island in the Atlantic on the 25th of June, 1960, at 2334 local time, an operation range vessel codenamed whiskey was retrieving the data cassette from a missile test labeled 1802. This small boat was launched to recover the floating cassette illuminated by strobes and monitored from the whiskey and aircraft above.

00;03;46;20 - 00;04;10;28
Unknown
As the smaller boat got within 3 to 500 yards of the strobe, the crew observed a steady white or yellowish light appear 100 yards from the cassette from under the surface, and roughly 25 degrees from their boat. This light appeared to be on or very close to the surface, and no waves appeared to break over the light. The event lasted for 10s and was spotted by the RCA photographer Test Observer.

00;04;11;00 - 00;04;38;06
Unknown
Divers of the recovery crew, as well as the pilot and copilot of the recovery plane Bluebook claim this sighting was a flare. However, it was established none of the planes or vessels released a flare over this site, and this story reminds me very closely of the encounter I relayed from Lou Elizondo in my last video, where a diving team sent to retrieve missile data, observed a massive USO emerge from the depths and intercept the missile.

00;04;38;08 - 00;05;01;22
Unknown
And speaking of rust Blue Book conclusions, we can look at the SS Morgantown victory on the 11th of January, 1966, near 1000 miles southeast of Tokyo, the third mate, helmsman, and Bo Lookout observed a cigar shaped object approached their ship. The cigar object glowed with an orange yellow color, with a bright glow on its front and a body with a polar glow.

00;05;01;24 - 00;05;23;24
Unknown
The body had two lights on top, and the entire craft was estimated to be 200 to 250ft long and 35 to 40ft in length. The object near the starboard side of the ship from the horizon, and then turned 180 degrees to avoid going over the vessel. It approached the ship within one mile at an elevation of far less than 400ft.

00;05;23;26 - 00;05;49;06
Unknown
After hovering for 30s, the object crossed in front of the ship and once again changed directions. This incident occurred for three minutes until the object entered the sea. The ship master believed a plane had crashed and ordered the ship to conduct a search. Bluebook identified this case as the cosmos 33 satellite decay. However, this explanation does not account for the object hovering and speed and directional changes.

00;05;49;09 - 00;06;13;29
Unknown
If you would like to read more on ship based UAP sightings, I highly recommend this PDF on maritime UFO and USO research and Bluebook. This stat rich report highlights some exceptional data, such as the split between Bluebook sightings between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Of the 258 ship visual cases, 104 occurred in the Atlantic and 155 in the Pacific.

00;06;14;01 - 00;06;28;03
Unknown
This data highlights. While there is an increase in Pacific sightings and possibly a hotspot, UFO and USO sightings are not an isolated incident on water.

00;06;28;06 - 00;06;52;26
Unknown
Historically, the Soviets kept a tight lid on UAP reports. In fact, Russian UFO stigma has been as oppressive, if not more than our own here in the United States. One day I would like to cover the USSR UFO stigma and files at length, but that is not the topic of our video today, because fortunately, the former Soviet Union has a trove of USO reports that are indeed worth investigating.

00;06;52;29 - 00;07;14;19
Unknown
I will primarily be pulling from the case log of Russia's USO secrets by Paul Stonehill and Philip Mantle. However, I will only be discussing cases that I find especially worthy of note and can track down additional reporting on many of these cases are just stories, and we don't have direct access to Soviet declassified files like we do with Bluebook.

00;07;14;21 - 00;07;43;13
Unknown
So I will be doing my best to vet these cases. Let's dive into a handful of the most interesting. On October 7th, 1977, the Soviet submarine repair ship Volga was piloting the Barents Sea. Its radar detected an unknown object approaching at a distance of roughly 60 miles. The Volga. As Captain Tarentum approached the bridge to see nine bright discs moving in from the northeast, the discs arrived and circled the vessel for a span of 18 minutes.

00;07;43;16 - 00;08;10;11
Unknown
During the encounter, ship comm links malfunctioned, similar to the Major Jafari in the 1976 Tehran UFO incident. After the discs depart, the ship comms and operations returned to normal, raising concern in the Soviet Navy fleet Admiral Nikolai Ivanovich Smirnov no, not the liquor, issued a directive on mandatory reporting of UFO sightings by Soviet hydrographic, scientific research and reconnaissance ships, similar to Jan App.

00;08;10;11 - 00;08;34;18
Unknown
146 see an open map. Directive 3820. The directive was authorized by naval officer and ufologist Vladimir G. A saucer and signed by Naval Deputy Chief of Staff Pyotr in the voice of. This case was not only discussed in Russia's USO secrets, but also in Jacques Villa's book UFO Chronicles of the Soviet Union a cosmic samizdat, on pages 29 to 30.

00;08;34;20 - 00;09;04;25

The link to the book free, of course, will be in the video description, so check that out for yourself. Kamchatka Peninsula is a fascinating region of Russia. The almost 500 square kilometer area separates the Sea of Okhotsk from the Pacific Ocean, according to Russia's USO secrets and an article written by Soviet scientist Valentin Salom Chekov. On a bright day in August of 1970, we follow a group of hydrologists conducting research within a motorboat on can track the lake.

00;09;04;28 - 00;09;32;23
Unknown
Suddenly, around a kilometer away from the boat, a massive dome of water shot out of the lake in which rose a gray colored oval object estimated to be 40 to 60m in length. The object rose to an altitude of nearly 100m and hovered motionless. As it did, the motorboat engine stalled. Horrified, the team gazed at the object until it accelerated away, rapidly, restoring functions to their engine.

00;09;32;25 - 00;09;58;23
Unknown
What fascinates me about this case is the disruption to the boat engine, something we see Kevin Knuth discuss at the Soar Foundation, and an aspect of many UFO encounters from vehicles in the same year of our Soviet submarine case of 77 is one of the strangest encounters I have heard. This information is relayed from the manuscripts and books of Felix Sigel, one of Russia's most well-respected ufologists.

00;09;58;25 - 00;10;24;16
Unknown
On June 1577, the Soviet ship Novak, whose netsuke navigated the Gulf of Guinea, Kiel, Ecuador a radiogram sent by the ship relayed at night straight ahead of the vehicle, a white luminescent sphere rose from the water. It flew around the ship, hovered 20m over the vessel, flew higher, zigzagged and dove back into the water. And with the Russians, my friends, this is just the tip of the iceberg.

00;10;24;19 - 00;10;51;17
Unknown
I'd like to leave you with this clip from this Russian documentary on us from 2006, where we see a Russian submarine captain discuss the phenomenon. I highly recommend checking out this whole documentary. And of course the link will be in the video description. Yeah, yeah, I'm still waiting for you, Leon. You better looking at my sphere in the sticky dough sphere, a mooring hole, many kinds of things.

00;10;51;17 - 00;11;08;25

There's not a common. It exists. And you want a steam problem is, in your mind, this also means it. If a. So when you open this, you push as a secret.

00;11;08;28 - 00;11;40;17
Unknown
But one country that has an abundance of declassified UFO USO government documentation is Australia. The Australian UFO files consist of a multitude of reports, papers and files on anomalous sightings. In fact, the Royal Australian Air Force's first official unknown reported UAS. Unusual aerial sighting occurred on January 23rd, 1964 and describes quote seen at sea by crew of a vessel northeast point of Groot Island, Western Australia.

00;11;40;20 - 00;12;10;21
Unknown
Large lights and water made compass go haywire. Shadow in center of lights rotated clockwise, causing lights to pulsate and quote. The tampering of instrumentation is something we see again and again pop up in UFO USO encounters, and certainly not missed by Australia. A report was drafted on magnetic disturbance and local compass activity from the sighting. Around this time in the 50s and 60s, the Australian authorities began to take USO and UFO sightings seriously.

00;12;10;24 - 00;12;51;08
Unknown
See these newspaper clippings of civilian UAP encounters near water, clipped and included alongside government and military encounters, such as this 1963 clipping about a fisherman observing a light shoot up from the water hover and disappear. Australian intelligence agencies actually track reports of Australian encounters, very similar to both the fisherman encounter and her 1977 Soviet encounter. This 1967 incident details a sighting in which both staff from the Department of Works and local offices observed lights pop up from out of the sea, rise to a great height curve, and return to the oceans.

00;12;51;10 - 00;13;20;08
Unknown
Many of these sightings were accompanied by three distinct flashes. Once returned to sea. Remember back to our SS City of Al Moco case and Project Blue Book. It is worthy to note that Lieutenant Commander of Australian Intelligence A.F. Perry hypothesized these could possibly be experiments conducted by several oil search teams. However, this does not seem consistent as this sort of sighting has been seen by Australia, the Soviets, and Americans outside of the Australian government.

00;13;20;08 - 00;13;58;18
Unknown
The citizens of the Land Down Under have some fascinating stories of uso's, especially regarding objects shooting out of the sea and performing intelligently controlled maneuvers. In 1947, Port Augusta, South Australia, Frederic Walter and Emma Flavell observed five gray oblong objects rise from the sea and move from northwest to southeast. This sighting was also observed by two railroad workers, who described five white or light pink egg shaped objects rise from the sea, but with the added detail of quivering, similar to our MV marker, a case mentioned earlier in the video.

00;13;58;21 - 00;14;28;17
Unknown
Cigar shapes have been seen in our skies and oceans throughout world and Australian history. Around the time the Australian government began taking UAP seriously, we can find a case that appeared in the July to August issue of Flying Saucer Review. 1966 to 67 private pilot C Adams and television cameraman Mr. Les Hendy reported seeing 4 or 5 mysterious objects three miles east of Fraser Island, approaching the objects from the sky.

00;14;28;20 - 00;14;56;08
Unknown
There appeared to be two dark colored cigars, narrow and up to 100ft long, accompanied by three smaller objects. The two noticed the object standing still in the water and started to submerge as the aircraft approached within two miles. Initially thought to be whales or submarines, the men and independent sightings from nearby C Bray Hotel observed that the objects did not disturb the surface when submerging, almost like they did not interact with the water.

00;14;56;11 - 00;15;09;18
Unknown
This interaction with fluid is extremely similar to the H.M. in the Southland case. Knuth describes at the sole foundation, which oddly enough, occurred near New Zealand.

00;15;09;20 - 00;15;47;01
Unknown
We all know of the famous alleged UFO encounter by explorer Christopher Columbus, where he and his crew saw what they described as a wax candle rising and falling in the middle of the ocean in the middle of the night. But I don't have enough evidence or resources to talk about this case. What I do want to talk about are two cases that occurred around the turn of the 20th century that are documented by the US Hydrographic Bureau on November 12th, 1887, captain RF Moore of the English steamer the Siberian encountered a USO ten nautical miles off Cape Race, Newfoundland.

00;15;47;03 - 00;16;08;27
Unknown
The captain observed an enormous fireball rise from the sea to 50ft, moving towards the craft, then speed away into the sky. At the time, the Hydrographic Bureau in Washington named it, quote, one of the most rare and most difficult to explain electrical phenomena. But as far as I know, I have not seen any cases of ball lightning exiting the sea.

00;16;09;00 - 00;16;31;23
Unknown
And in Africa, the Gulf of Guinea, 1902, four men aboard the ship, the Fort Salisbury, witnessed an immense object sinking into the ocean. The cigar shaped object measured nearly 200m long and 300m wide. As the object passed under the ship, the men on the vessel described two orange lights lit at the front and two blue green light shining at the other end.

00;16;31;26 - 00;16;47;21
Unknown
This case, in my opinion, could represent a submarine, however, seen as popular submarines at this time, such as the early German U-boat measured solely 41m long. I still find this case anomalous.

00;16;47;23 - 00;17;12;27
Unknown
And now we get to an anomalous and perplexing USO called the Maritime Light Wheel. Throughout the late 19th and early 20th century, there was a hotspot of peculiar phenomenon observed by sailors all over the Eastern Hemisphere. And it's worthy to note this just wasn't an isolated incident in fact, the maritime light wheel is reported on in that Russian USO documentary I mentioned earlier on the film.

00;17;12;29 - 00;17;51;04

As described in the documentary, in many cases the maritime light wheel is described as a wheel surrounded by spokes of brilliant white light that can appear below the water surface or hovering in the air, serving as a possibly trans medium craft. I must note also, as they talked about in the video, some attribute these USO wheels to a rare interaction between bioluminescent algae and pressure waves in an otherwise calm water.

00;19;55;18 - 00;20;30;09
Unknown
However, I do not think this explanation has any sort of consensus or full acceptance. But let's review the earliest sightings of these wheels. And mind you, there are many, many, many more sightings of the maritime light wheel that have been observed. But I just want to recount a few of the earliest. On March 27th, 1873, the ship Adelaide voyage from Le Bon to Singapore, Captain Lemon noticed a peculiar blinding milky white light appeared beneath the waves, about two ship lengths from the vessel, emitting waves of light described as quote, flakes of snow.

00;20;30;09 - 00;20;53;10
Unknown
When driven over the rocks by a strong wind and quote. The light followed the ship, traveling at 4 to 5 knots for roughly half an hour before slowly disappearing. Leibman stated he had not seen anything like this in his 26 years of maritime life. We can find the description of this case in the National Library of Australia, mentioned in an 1873 news article in The Argus.

00;20;53;13 - 00;21;19;11
Unknown
An almost USO flap was experienced in the Persian Gulf from 1879 to 1901. An initial UFO sighting was reported to the Admiralty by Captain Evans, a hydrography for the British Navy. On May 15th, 1879, Jay Pringle of the HMS vulture reported, quote luminous waves or pulsations in the water moving at great speed and quote passing under the vulture.

00;21;19;13 - 00;21;44;12
Unknown
It was at this time Pringle noticed two objects of the east and west what appear to be, quote, revolving wheels with a center on that bearing, and whose spokes were illuminated and quote worthy. To note. These two wheels were rotating in equal and opposite directions, and the spokes were about 25ft in length. It is unclear if these wheels were submerged into the water, as the language of this 19th century English gets a little tricky here.

00;21;44;14 - 00;22;12;11
Unknown
The second instance in the Persian Gulf occurred in May of 1880 from the British India Company steamer Patna. Captain Avan, Mister Manning, third officer, and others observed two enormous luminous wheels appear on each side of the ship. Near 11:30 p.m. the wheels were, quote, whirling around, the spokes of which seemed to brush along the ship. The spokes would be 200 to 300 yards long, and resembled the birch rods of the dame school.

00;22;12;13 - 00;22;33;15
Unknown
Each wheel contained about 16 spokes, and although the wheels must have been some 5 to 600 yards in diameter, the spokes would be distinctly seen all the way around and quote the men described. The appearance of the spokes could almost be represented by standing in a boat and flashing a bull's eyes lantern horizontally along the surface of the water, round and round.

00;22;33;17 - 00;23;00;15
Unknown
The final Persian encounter with this uso was observed on April 4th and 1901, where Captain Hosein of the steamship Qila encountered, quote. Vast shafts of light suddenly appeared. Shaft followed a shaft upon the surface of the sea, but it was only a faint light, and in about 15 minutes died out, having appeared suddenly and having died out. Gradually these shafts revolved at a velocity of about 60 miles an hour from earlier the year of 1880.

00;23;00;15 - 00;23;25;05
Unknown
I just mentioned this wheel like object was possibly seen off the Malabar Coast of India on January 5th by commander of the SS Shahjahan, Aari Harris describes a clear night over calm waters star shining bright and no moon present. At roughly 10 p.m., Harrison, the ship's third officer, noticed a milky white circle in the sky resembling, quote, the nebula sometimes seen in the heavens.

00;23;25;07 - 00;23;52;18
Unknown
Approaching the object, the sailors stopped the vessel to try and gain an understanding of this anomalous object and its waves of light. The last old example here I will cover occurred on the 10th of June, 1909, and was actually featured in Scientific American issue 151, which relays the Nautical Meteorological Annual, published by the Danish Meteorological Institute. A report on a singular phenomena while sailing through the Strait of Malacca.

00;23;52;19 - 00;24;19;15
Unknown
Captain Gabe of the SS Bintang observed a vast revolving wheel of light under the water, long arms issuing from a center around which the whole system appeared to rotate and quote surfacing. This wheel was so vast, only half of it could be seen at a time. With the center lane near the horizon, the wheel was able to move forward in very and speed and rotation disappearing when the center was right under the vessel.

00;24;19;17 - 00;24;43;23
Unknown
And like our last 1880 case, these maritime light wheels aren't just seen below the water in the same Danish Meteorological Institute there reports another instance in 1910 where Captain Bryer of the Dutch steamship Valentin was sailing in the South China Sea. Here the captain, first and second mate and the first engineer all observed an object hovering above the water.

00;24;43;23 - 00;25;05;26
Unknown
Quote. It looked like a horizontal wheel rapidly turning. But my friends, thank you so much for watching today as we took a deeper dive into Uso's throughout history. Please excuse the rash guard I'm wearing. I just got home from training, but phalanx, if you're watching, I'm always open for a sponsor. But anyways, guys, I got such a great reaction to my first video on USO.

00;25;05;26 - 00;25;24;17
Unknown
I had to make a follow up and show that it doesn't matter what time period where, and it doesn't matter what country we're in. There are stories of unexplained things in the water as far as the maritime light wheel goes. I'm pretty torn on that. Whether that is a craft object or possibly some sort of more anomalous natural phenomena.

00;25;24;20 - 00;25;49;05
Unknown
I'll include in the video description a kind of not really debunk, but a paper kind of possibly exploring explanations for this phenomena. But still the fact these are seen in the Persian Gulf, in Russia, all around the world is fascinating to me. But even more fascinating to me are Australian Bluebook and Soviet files, all depicting very similar experiences.

Tic tac shaped craft cigars, fireballs exiting the water, fireballs exiting the water that some that are almost curious about the ship. Egg shapes leaving the water that frightens the Soviet hydrologists. But we see multiple cases of these sort of light balls leaving the water, dancing around and shooting off into the sky or back into the water. As far as the TikToks go, we often see these things hovering slightly above water in multiple cases, saying they're quivering or gyrating or slowly submerging under the water, but not affecting the water surface.

Similar to the, case Kevin Knuth talks about. So I think we can find a lot of answers to the UFO phenomena by looking in our oceans. There's so many more cases, so many I wanted to talk about but couldn't really find reputable, reputable sources for, such as some, Chilean incidents that supposedly in the military, a fleet of of saucers approached a a craft.

But until then, we'll just keep digging in case files. It's a shame that, there's not a lot of information at Bluebook. We can thank op nav 3820 and Jan 146 C for that. But, you know, we'll work with what we're given. If one day I can get in contact with George Knapp and see if any of those UFO files he smuggled out of Russia pertain to us.

So I would very much like to do that. But where I stand now, USO is one of the most fascinating aspects of the phenomenon. The fact these craft can operate in air or undersea trans medium objects without really changing their flight characteristics is insane to me. So if you guys haven't yet watched that Russian documentary, it's actually really darn good.

I highly suggest watching it. Does a great job exploring kind of the Soviet side of USO. And of course, you can listen to talk. Someone talk in a Russian accent for 45 minutes, so that's great. As always, guys, thank you so much for watching. I've seen a lot of added support with the channel lately with the Kingman video and, getting retweeted by Ross, so that's been great.

I love all of you guys. Thanks so much for being here. Remember to like and retweet. Leave a comment on the video. Let me know what you think. Let me know what Casey's crashes. Whatever you want me to tackle next. That has to do with the phenomenon, of course. Nothing, nothing random. So just let me know. And again, thanks for being here, guys.
