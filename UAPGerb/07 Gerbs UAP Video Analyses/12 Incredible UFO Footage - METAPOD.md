### 🔍 Key Discussion Points

12. **Unique “Pod” Structure**
    
    - One of the few UFOs allegedly showing a **clear, dome-like front**, possibly for observation.
13. **Recurrent Shape Across Decades**
    
    - Spanning from **1998** in Peru to more modern captures in **Mexico**, **Vancouver**, **Texas**, and an alleged **Navy leak**.
14. **Potential Explanations**
    
    - **Balloon / Inflatable**: Some debunkers point to inflation artifacts or wobble consistent with drifting objects.
    - **Hoax / CGI**: Observers note frame jitters and unusual camera processing.
    - **Legitimate Craft**: Others find consistent flight characteristics, reflection details, and the “transparent dome” compelling.
15. **Anonymous Witness & Email**
    
    - The original sender “Modesta” withheld **exact location** and used partial pseudonyms.
    - Raises the question of how many details remain unverified vs. how many are intentionally concealed.
16. **Relationship to Other Known UAP**
    
    - Suggestive parallels with the **Gimbal** shape (though not conclusive).
    - Correlations with reported **transmedium** or **anti-gravity** capabilities.

### Provenance & Chain of Custody

1. **Initial Capture (September 6, 2015)**
    
    - Allegedly filmed by two individuals in the countryside near **El Escorial**, Spain.
    - Primary witness identified as **“Modesta”** (and sometimes referred to as “Modesto” or “Mo”) in correspondence.
2. **Contact with UFOvni Channel (September 7, 2015)**
    
    - Modesta emailed **UFOvni**, a Spanish-language UFO YouTube channel, stating they had extraordinary footage.
    - Requested anonymity regarding exact coordinates, citing personal reasons.
    - Offered to send the **micro SD card** directly or provide a **cloud link** of the video file.
3. **YouTube Upload & Early Discussion (September 7–11, 2015)**
    
    - UFOvni published the footage under the title “OVNI METAPOD” (exact wording varied).
    - **ThirdPhaseOfSun** and other websites quickly **mirrored or discussed** the clip, fueling online debate.
    - A now-defunct **Portuguese forum (ETs e Etc.)** referenced the video on **September 8** as potentially authentic or impressive but unverified.
4. **Subsequent Takedowns & Reuploads**
    
    - The original UFOvni posting was eventually **taken down** (reason unclear; possibly at the request of the witness).
    - A separate channel, “UFO Invasions,” reuploaded the footage in **2017**, which was also later removed.
    - Various **stabilized versions** and partial clips remain on YouTube (e.g., from iTBS), along with analysis on Reddit and Metabunk.
5. **Current Status**
    
    - The **raw, original source file** has never been published in full resolution to the best of public knowledge.
    - Email records indicate the footage was initially **transferred privately** from Modesta to UFOvni.
    - Multiple **reuploads** now circulate, often at lower quality or with added stabilization.

**Notes:**

- The witness’s **identity and exact location** remain undisclosed.
- No publicly verifiable metadata (e.g., **file hashes**, **EXIF data**) confirming the original date or device type has been released.
- The chain of custody is thus **incomplete**; critics argue this leaves room for potential hoaxing or modifications.

### ❓ Open Questions

11. **Do the repeated appearances of “Metapod” across decades suggest a stable, recognizable UFO type?**
12. **Could any advanced balloon or drone technology explain the pod’s shape and silent maneuvers?**
13. **Is there stronger evidence linking the rumored 2022 Navy footage to this same phenomenon?**
14. **How can the camera jitter vs. actual object movement be definitively distinguished?**

**Author’s Note**  
The Metapod UFO remains one of the more **visually compelling** examples of an unorthodox craft. Its purported glass-like dome, metallic body, and numerous **global sightings** fuel ongoing debate. As with most UFO evidence, its authenticity hangs on **limited witness data** and a patchwork of **similar reports**, leaving the door open for both **debunkers** and **believers** to present their cases.
