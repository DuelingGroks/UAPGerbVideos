# 14. UFOs in the Private Sector – Battelle Memorial Institute
**Video Published:** February 18, 2024  
**Video Link:** [YouTube – Battelle & UFOs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tISTJRPOqFo)  
**Approx. Length:** ~15 minutes

## 📌 Overview

In this video, Gerb conducts the **first deep dive** into **private sector companies** tied to the UAP phenomenon, starting with **Battelle Memorial Institute**. A non-profit organization with a long history of **classified government contracts** (from the Manhattan Project to Apollo 11 R&D), Battelle has allegedly been involved in **UFO cover-ups** and direct **material analysis**—possibly even working on **shape-memory alloys** recovered from incidents like **Roswell**.

Among the revelations and allegations:

- **Project Stork** (1950s): Battelle’s covert role in analyzing UFO reports and “reassuring the public.”  
- **Special Report No. 14**: Contradictory findings that claim “no physical UFO materials,” despite Battelle’s own studies on “Nitinol-like” alloys.  
- **EJ Center’s Testimony**: A researcher who claimed to have studied UFO crash debris at Battelle, specifically referencing “flying saucer parts.”  
- **Links to Modern UAP Secrecy**: Ronald Moultrie (Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence) served on Battelle’s board, tying the Institute to official UAP denial narratives.

## 🎥 Timestamps

- **0:00 – Intro**: Battelle’s storied history (Manhattan Project, Apollo 11, etc.) and potential dark secrets about UFO research.  
- **1:52 – Project Stork**: How Battelle helped the USAF manage and categorize UFO reports in the early 1950s.  
- **3:49 – Special Report No. 14**: Contradictions regarding the existence (or nonexistence) of physical UFO material.  
- **4:16 – Exotic Metallurgy**: Evidence Battelle studied “shape-memory alloys” (e.g., Nitinol) possibly stemming from the 1947 Roswell crash.  
- **8:43 – EJ Center**: The researcher whose 1949 work on advanced titanium alloys may link directly to alleged UFO debris.  
- **11:10 – Jacques Vallee**: Mention of Vallee’s references to private contractors (including Battelle) holding recovered UFO material.  
- **12:47 – AARO, Battelle, & Ronald Moultrie**: Connections between modern UAP “disinformation” and high-level board memberships.  
- **14:42 – Conclusion**: Battelle’s significant footprint in UFO secrecy, potential future topics (e.g., Lockheed, Carlisle Group).

## 📝 Key Takeaways

1. **Private Sector Cover-Up**  
   - Battelle has historically **aided the USAF** in categorizing and downplaying UFO sightings (Project Stork).  
   - Possibly engaged in “**reassuring the public**” to keep them calm rather than seeking the truth.

2. **Shape-Memory Alloy Studies**  
   - Research from 1949 suggests Battelle worked on **Nitinol-like metals** over a decade before its official discovery in 1961.  
   - This strongly implicates the **Roswell crash** if debris was shipped to Wright-Patterson and then studied by Battelle.

3. **EJ Center & Roswell Debris**  
   - Testimony from the 1994 MUFON Ohio article mentions center analyzing “saucer parts” — matching the timeline of unusual “titanium-based alloys.”  
   - The connection was hidden until **2010** declassification of early Battelle reports.

4. **Modern Implications**  
   - **Ronald Moultrie**, a key figure overseeing AARO and UAP disclosures, once served on Battelle’s board, raising questions about conflict of interest or suppression of evidence.  
   - Reiterates the claim that “private classification standards” can bypass typical FOIA or government oversight.

## ❓ Open Questions

- Did Battelle (or other contractors) continue hush-hush “crash retrieval” R&D beyond the 1950s or into modern day black projects?  
- Could newly formed offices (e.g., AARO) gain the legal authority to seize or investigate proprietary materials?  
- Are there additional whistleblowers (like EJ Center) willing to publicly detail Battelle’s direct involvement with UFO artifacts?
