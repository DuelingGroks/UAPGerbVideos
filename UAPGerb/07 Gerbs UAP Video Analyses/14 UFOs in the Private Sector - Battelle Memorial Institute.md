**Video Published:** February 18, 2024  
**Video Link:** [YouTube – Battelle & UFOs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tISTJRPOqFo)  
**Approx. Length:** ~15 minutes  

---

## 📌 Overview

In this video, Gerb conducts the **first deep dive** into **private sector companies** tied to the UAP phenomenon, starting with **Battelle Memorial Institute**. A non-profit organization with a long history of **classified government contracts** (from the Manhattan Project to Apollo 11 R&D), Battelle has allegedly been involved in **UFO cover-ups** and direct **material analysis**—possibly even working on **shape-memory alloys** recovered from incidents like **Roswell**.

Among the revelations and allegations:

- **Project Stork** (1950s): Battelle’s covert role in analyzing UFO reports and “reassuring the public.”  
- **Special Report No. 14**: Contradictory findings that claim “no physical UFO materials,” despite Battelle’s own studies on “Nitinol-like” alloys.  
- **EJ Center’s Testimony**: A researcher who claimed to have studied UFO crash debris at Battelle, specifically referencing “flying saucer parts.”  
- **Links to Modern UAP Secrecy**: Ronald Moultrie (Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence) served on Battelle’s board, tying the Institute to official UAP denial narratives.

- **1:52 – Project Stork**: How Battelle helped the USAF manage and categorize UFO reports in the early 1950s.  
- **3:49 – Special Report No. 14**: Contradictions regarding the existence (or nonexistence) of physical UFO material.  
- **4:16 – Exotic Metallurgy**: Evidence Battelle studied “shape-memory alloys” (e.g., Nitinol) possibly stemming from the 1947 Roswell crash.  
- **8:43 – EJ Center**: The researcher whose 1949 work on advanced titanium alloys may link directly to alleged UFO debris.  
- **11:10 – Jacques Vallee**: Mention of Vallee’s references to private contractors (including Battelle) holding recovered UFO material.  
- **12:47 – AARO, Battelle, & Ronald Moultrie**: Connections between modern UAP “disinformation” and high-level board memberships.  
- **14:42 – Conclusion**: Battelle’s significant footprint in UFO secrecy, potential future topics (e.g., Lockheed, Carlisle Group).

## 📝 Key Takeaways

1. **Private Sector Cover-Up**  
   - Battelle has historically **aided the USAF** in categorizing and downplaying UFO sightings (Project Stork).  
   - Possibly engaged in “**reassuring the public**” to keep them calm rather than seeking the truth.

2. **Shape-Memory Alloy Studies**  
   - Research from 1949 suggests Battelle worked on **Nitinol-like metals** over a decade before its official discovery in 1961.  
   - This strongly implicates the **Roswell crash** if debris was shipped to Wright-Patterson and then studied by Battelle.

3. **EJ Center & Roswell Debris**  
   - Testimony from the 1994 MUFON Ohio article mentions center analyzing “saucer parts” — matching the timeline of unusual “titanium-based alloys.”  
   - The connection was hidden until **2010** declassification of early Battelle reports.

4. **Modern Implications**  
   - **Ronald Moultrie**, a key figure overseeing AARO and UAP disclosures, once served on Battelle’s board, raising questions about conflict of interest or suppression of evidence.  
   - Reiterates the claim that “private classification standards” can bypass typical FOIA or government oversight.

Meet Battelle Memorial Institute, a private, nonprofit applied sciences and technology development company whose mission is to deliver scientific discovery and applied research that makes the world a better place to live. This private nonprofit has a prolific list of USG contracted work, including classified stops. Battelle has a storied history in the technological development of our U.S. society, including research into the fabrication of uranium for the Manhattan Project from 39 to 52.

00;00;31;19 - 00;01;03;11
Unknown
Development of the photocopy machine and UPC barcode system. Work on combustion electronics. Energy conversion propellants. All for Apollo 11, and military research into biological and chemical weapons defense systems, and more. Today, Battelle manages the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center at Los Alamos National Laboratory and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, NREL, as well as Oak Ridge National Lab, all of which are D.o.e. sponsored labs.

00;01;03;13 - 00;01;35;18
Unknown
So we already see some ties here with Battelle and the USG. UAP work in Los Alamos in the Doe. But what if I told you Battelle is harboring a dark secret that the company has a long history of studying UFOs, dating the USG and USAF in the UFO coverup, and has even conducted analysis on UFO material. Hey guys, it is UAP group and we are finally going to start to dive into one of the most fascinating aspects of the UFO phenomena the private sector's connection to the study of UFOs.

00;01;35;24 - 00;02;00;10
Unknown
Numerous key figures such as David Grush, Lou Elizondo, Chris Mellon, Eric Davis, former Senator Harry Reid and more have made direct statements that USG defense contractors have a direct hand in the reverse engineering and crash retrieval of UAP. So today we are going to dive into one such company with real, dirty, hands on work of UFO material and research.

00;02;00;12 - 00;02;28;19
Unknown
The Battelle Memorial Institute, the earliest tracing of Battelle and UFOs, goes to something called Project Stork. In 1952, the director of the Central Intelligence received a memorandum titled Flying Saucers, which detailed an arrangement between Atic, the Air Force Technology Intelligence Committee, and Battelle Memorial Institute for the contractor to establish a machine indexing system for official reports of UFO sightings.

00;02;28;21 - 00;02;54;24
Unknown
On the 9th of January, 1953, Battelle doctor Howard C cross proposes that the ongoing Project Stork, quote, assist the Air Force in reassuring the public that everything is well under control with respect to the UFO problem. At the time, this memo was classified secret and even calls to attention Captain Edward J. Ruppel, the project sign Grudge and Blue book director.

00;02;54;26 - 00;03;28;15
Unknown
I've talked about him in the history of the stigma. So check that video out if you haven't. If you remember from that same video in 1953, the Robertson Panel was conducted to ensure that all national security agencies should strip UFOs of, quote, special status and suggest the public there is no legitimate evidence of their existence. While the Robertson Panel was conducted, Battelle had been commissioned around the same time to separately analyze all Air Force UFO cases away from Bluebook or these official panels under codenamed stork.

00;03;28;17 - 00;03;49;07
Unknown
This project, parallel to Bluebook, was even mentioned by J. Alan Hynek during his attempted testimony at the Robertson panel. Thanks to the efforts of Soufan, the computer UFO network, I have been able to find all seven Project Stork status reports. That is another analysis for another day. However, all parts of course will be provided in the video description.

00;03;49;09 - 00;04;27;07
Unknown
On the 5th of May 1955, Battelle in 80 published a comprehensive analysis of 3200 UFO sightings titled Special Report 14. This report concluded that UFOs are not aerial aircraft beyond human scientific knowledge, because no physical matter had ever been recorded from any UFO sighting. But if we dig deeper, there is a massive contradiction here from Mattel's claim that no physical matter had ever been recovered six years earlier, in 1949, Battelle had been contracted by none other than Wright-Patterson Air Force Base to perform analysis on shape memory alloys.

00;04;27;09 - 00;04;55;16
Unknown
See on screen now and in the video notes the first and second progress report covering the period of September 1st to October 21st, 1949 on research and development of titanium alloys. Contract number 3303 83736. The bulk of these investigations focus on NIT Knoll, a nickel titanium alloy, a metal that would not be officially discovered until 1961 by Doctor William J.

00;04;55;17 - 00;05;26;23
Unknown
Buehler. So Battelle was performing analysis on the nickel titanium sheet metal alloy now known as nit null, over ten years prior to its official discovery. Well, what exactly is knitting on? For you material scientists out there, and I am not one of you. Knitting all has the unique properties of super elasticity and shape memory. The metal can be subjected to high levels of stress and snap back to its original shape when pressure is released, showing no deformation on the material.

00;05;26;25 - 00;05;57;01
Unknown
Knitting all is also elastic caloric, where the material heats up when exposed to a mechanical force field. When this heat is released into the environment and the force field is removed, the material super cools and extracts the same amount of heat from the environment again. If I'm not stressing this enough, knitting is a remarkable material that is exceedingly difficult to manufacture due to the exceptionally high and tight compositional control required and the tremendous reactivity of titanium.

00;05;57;03 - 00;06;27;03
Unknown
The material is even used for thermal and electrical actuators, implants due to the materials biocompatibility and structural dampening. So again, Battelle was contracted to perform a material analysis on an alloy that is exceedingly difficult to make, requiring vacuum arc rim melting or vacuum induction re melting to manufacture today in the 21st century, but had this material in the late 40s, specifically 1949.

00;06;27;05 - 00;06;58;17
Unknown
And does this alloy not sound almost exactly like the material that was discovered in the 1947 Roswell crash that Jesse Marcel described as an exceedingly light metal that would retain its shape after deformation. And remember, Jesse Marcel was a military officer who was taken to the UFO crash debris field with rancher Mac Brazel, who discovered these materials and then was later told by General Ramey to pose with balsa wood and aluminum foil to push the weather balloon theory.

00;06;58;17 - 00;07;33;08
Unknown
And all of this is, in Marcel's own words. More damning is that this debris from a UFO was supposedly shipped to none other than you guessed it, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. So to summarize, I am directly inferring that the 1947 Roswell crash led to the discovery of the material known as nitinol, and thus Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and the U.S. Air Force contracted Battelle to perform a material analysis on that mill in 1949, over ten years before its quote unquote, official discovery in the private sector.

00;07;33;13 - 00;08;01;07
Unknown
But this wouldn't be a UAP video without the mention of the Atomic Energy Commission, would it not? Well, this study by Battelle into Titanium Base Alloys was a research and development project under the Atomic Energy Commission. For those of you who have never watched one of my videos, UFO records and materials have been classically misclassified under the 1954 Atomic Energy Agreement under trans classified nuclear foreign material.

00;08;01;08 - 00;08;36;05
Unknown
With this report, the work on titanium alloys is one of very few studies without classification. It's not labeled as classified, unclassified, or declassified, but rather is labeled as restricted. Essentially, this is a private sector classification standard in which only need to know read and access is solely allowed. If you've never heard of this before, people like David Grush have spoken that part of the reason that private industries are used for UFO studies is because they have their own legal classification standards that can't be breached by people with SOP access, like Grush himself.

00;08;36;05 - 00;09;12;00
Unknown
But even more perplexing, these studies into nitinol were not declassified until 2010. But we can go deeper because I have the most bizarre connection to make with Battelle and this nitinol UFO material. Within Battelle Report two, we observe an inconspicuous subsection titled, quote, Analytical Methods for Titanium based Alloys by one Acey Eckert and E.J. center, a senior research chemical engineer who worked for Battelle from 1939 to 1957.

00;09;12;03 - 00;09;40;05
Unknown
Nothing out of the ordinary right center section of the report deals with titanium purity. Exceptionally pure titanium is needed to make an internal memory metal due to the high reactivity as titanium as I mentioned above. So keep Edge Center's name in mind because let's travel to the summer of 1994 and read Into the Ohio UFO notebook by Doctor Irene Scott and the Mouffe on the mutual UFO network Board of Directors.

00;09;40;07 - 00;10;10;11
Unknown
This piece, titled, quote, The Ohio UFO Crash Connection and Other Stories, details an informant who came to move on in 1992. This man attended North High School in Columbus, Ohio in the late 1950s. In 1958, he dated a girl named Cathy, Center one night while visiting her home. Her father, one Elroy John Center, told them while working at Battelle, then remember, he left in 1957.

00;10;10;18 - 00;10;41;01
Unknown
He was, quote, responsible for a project which required him to study parts retrieved from a flying saucer. This section of Edge Center is under one decoding the Eye of the moon report. Roswell enthusiasts will know that Major Jesse Marcel, who was taken by rancher Mack Braswell to the debris field, found an I-beam amongst the wreckage and memory metal, which had strange characters on it resembling hieroglyphs.

00;10;41;03 - 00;11;07;01
Unknown
What's crucial to remember here, guys, is that although more often reports on Edge Center and his work on flying saucers for Battelle in 1994, Edge Center's 1949 work on nitinol was not declassified until 2010, so making this connection in less E.J. center was really, in fact, working on materials from across disk for Battelle, likely the Roswell wreckage, and blabbed about it.

00;11;07;01 - 00;11;31;19
Unknown
Once he left, Battelle in 58 would be impossible to put the cherry on top here. You Jerry fans will remember famed computer scientist and ufologist Jack Vela appearing on Jerry The Joe Rogan Podcast on the 4th of December 2020 with the phenomenon director James Fox. If you haven't seen The Phenomenon by Fox, I highly recommend checking this out.

00;11;31;19 - 00;11;57;01
Unknown
As well as Moment of Contact, which is about the Virginia Brazil UFO case. He's got great documentaries, but anyways, Jack is famous for spending many years connecting the private sector to official USG investigation. And within this podcast, he references one of the entities that helps control the UFO phenomena and the study of it in intelligence agencies is, quote, a private contractor.

00;11;57;03 - 00;12;26;15
Unknown
But Vallee nervously states he does not wish to disclose who in fact has UFO materials. Fox comes to all of our rescue to suggest the name of the group indirectly, by stating its involvement with the 1953 Robertson panel. As we studied above, this is the Tel Memorial Institute. I honestly don't know if I'm able to use Jerry clips from Spotify for copyright inclusion, so I'm not going to do that here.

00;12;26;17 - 00;12;54;14
Unknown
But if you wish to check this out, this is Jerry episode 1574 and begin at about an hour and 42 minutes in where Jack starts talking about pieces of metal recovered from UFOs. And this is where the discussion about what private industry has these materials, and where Battelle is suggested by Fox and the lay himself. And lastly, Battelle actually has shocking connections to Aero and Doctor Sean Kirkpatrick.

00;12;54;14 - 00;13;24;15
Unknown
Our modern day disinformation agent. Kirkpatrick and Aero were directed to report to one Ronald Moultrie, the undersecretary of defense for intelligence and security. And on most definitely, one of the hostile witnesses on David Grotius list. If you'll remember from my Sean Kirkpatrick and Arrow video in 2022, Aero and the DoD awarded a company called Sand Corp. a contract of $1.9 million for aero support services.

00;13;24;17 - 00;13;51;10
Unknown
This Sand Corp specializes in preventing leaks and stopping whistleblowers. Okay, and guess who oversaw this contract? The undersecretary of defense for Intelligence and Security one, Ronald Moultrie. Additionally, on the 16th December, 2022, Ronald Moultrie and Sean Kirkpatrick actually held a public press conference that they have not seen evidence of crashed UFOs that suggest they are craft from another planet or dimension.

00;13;51;12 - 00;14;21;14
Unknown
They additionally suggest there have been no crash recoveries. So here, alongside Kirkpatrick, we see that Ronald Moultrie is vested and interested in playing down UAP and stopping whistleblowers. Right? Well, the honorable Ronald Moultrie is actually a board member of Battelle and has been since 2016. And worse yet, Moultrie has tried to scrub this from his record, including taking down his board membership from his LinkedIn page.

00;14;21;17 - 00;15;04;17
Unknown
But fortunately, Pogo A.com stated on its website that Moultrie had been an advisory board member at Battelle and fortunately grabbed screenshots before Moultrie took this down. As I'm showing on screen right now. So even up to the modern day Battelle has its hooks sank in the USG and is controlling the UAP narrative. So Battelle. Not only have they played their hand in investigating UFOs for the USG and Air Force, but they've also aided in quelling public interest in UFOs by saying there's nothing to them and studying UFO material such as nitinol, which was likely recovered from the Roswell crash.

00;15;04;20 - 00;15;36;26
Unknown
Guys, if I can't stress this enough, the story of the Edge Center. In 1949, he worked for Battelle studying the nickel titanium alloys, and this was not declassified until 2010. But in 1994, the Ohio Move On general reported on E.J. center, who said he worked on parts of a flying saucer. Once he left Battelle in 58. That connection is just obscene and really adds another kernel of credibility to this already baffling case, with a ton of supporting evidence.

00;15;36;28 - 00;15;57;24
Unknown
I hope you guys enjoyed this look into Battelle. Battelle hands are insanely dirty in UFOs. So is Lockheed Martin. So as the Carlyle Group, I will make videos about those as well. But I hope everybody learned something today. For the people in the know, and I know I have a lot of fans who probably know a lot more than I do in some aspects of UAP.

00;15;57;27 - 00;16;25;26
Unknown
There was a leaker online about eight months ago, in 2023, I believe, who claimed he was a biologist at Battelle working on ebus extraterrestrial biological organisms. If I think of is he goes into the whole taxonomy of supposed aliens found and retrieved, crashed and dead. I decided not to include that just because, of course, there is a possibility that is a Larp, and I don't have supporting evidence right now for those claims.

00;16;25;28 - 00;16;47;10
Unknown
They are quite insane. Maybe I'll do a video on that in the future too. But I know some of you guys are probably thinking, why didn't he include that? Why don't you talk about that? But that's why. Just because I can't put together a body of evidence and make a well-researched thesis for that quote unquote, whistleblower. So maybe another time give me 100 hours to look into that.

00;16;47;10 - 00;17;04;29
Unknown
But I hope you guys are having a great week. I am sure not. I'm sorry if I'm disheveled. I'm a huge UFC fan, and last night I had to watch my favorite fighter in the world, Alexander Volkanovski, get knocked out. So I'm a little under the weather. So you guys, the support means the most. Please remember to like and subscribe and I will catch you guys on the next video.

00;17;05;01 - 00;17;05;15
Unknown
Thank you.
