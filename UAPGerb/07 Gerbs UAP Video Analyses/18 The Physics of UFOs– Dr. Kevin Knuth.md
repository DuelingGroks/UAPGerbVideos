Unknown
Even in today's world, UFO are not taken seriously by academia, and even with a wealth of multi-sensor data, the world of physics does not conduct hard analysis on UFO due to the powerful stigma, the idea that craft can perform aerial feats that violate our known laws of physics and break by magnitudes. Our current capabilities of material science are not just forgotten about, but actively scoffed at.

00;00;28;13 - 00;00;58;05
Unknown
While there is one accomplished academic who publicly takes the physics of UFOs seriously. PhD physicist Kevin Knuth. Hey guys, it's UAP group and for all my engineering and physics brethren, we are going to be very happy for today. We are going to tackle the Soar Foundation speech by Kevin Knuth on UAP physics and break down his published paper, Estimating Flight Characteristics of Anomalous Unidentified Aerial Vehicles.

00;00;58;06 - 00;01;22;03
Unknown
This is a video I've been looking forward to making for a long time, as regardless of how elusive and exotic UAP are, quantifiable data from multiple sensors on these craft's flight characteristics have and can be measured quickly. Who is Kevin Knuth? Professor Knuth is a physics professor at the University of Albany, and earned his PhD in physics from the University of Minnesota.

00;01;22;05 - 00;01;53;05
Unknown
He also conducts research into information physics, foundation of quantum mechanics, and Bayesian analysis applications. Recently, Knuth has taken a key interest in UFOs, serving as vice president of UAP, a nonprofit UFO field research group, and is a research affiliate to Avi Loeb's Galileo project, which searches for scientific evidence of any artifacts. In late 2023, the professor also held a mind boggling talk at the Sol Foundation, which we will cover today.

00;01;53;07 - 00;02;29;04
Unknown
On the 25th of September 2019, Knuth, along with Robert M Powell and Peter A really published a paper in entropy titled Estimating Flight Characteristics of Anomalous Unidentified Aerial Vehicles. This paper, which has deeply inspired me since its publication, aims to analyze the performance characteristics of some of the most well-documented UFO cases in history, including the 1951 Bethan encounter, the 1986 Japan Airlines Flight 1628, which I talked about in layer two of my iceberg, and a massive dive into the infamous 2004 Nimitz encounter.

00;02;29;11 - 00;03;02;06
Unknown
With emphasis on Commander David Fravor testimony and the Fleer footage in this paper, the physicists used data on UFOs to estimate flight speed, experienced G-Force, and more of the encounters to any of the community that may be interested in physics. This paper reads like a dream, so check it out for yourselves. We will not dive into the data and results now as the professor touches on these cases in the Sol Foundation talk in November of 2023, alongside powerful figures such as Carl Nel, David Grush, Gary Nolan and more.

00;03;02;08 - 00;03;34;12
Unknown
Knuth gave a talk to the Sol Foundation focused on the physics of UAP, and let's jump right in. Knuth begins his presentation by wisely stating his skepticism towards UFO and physicist, who deny the plausibility of physics defying craft, specifically stating, quote, I am skeptical of people who have assumed they have witnessed an alien spacecraft. End quote. Knuth humbly states that it is surprising academia stalwart Lee states, we know our physics when modern day research fails to unify even general relativity and quantum mechanics.

00;03;34;14 - 00;03;57;18
Unknown
Engineering is the act of using physics to find workarounds to problems, and unfamiliar engineering can look a whole lot like anomalous physics. So I am not ready to immediately jump to the conclusion that there is anomalous physics going on. When we see some anomalies similar to Nell, Kevin highlights the issue with the term UAP, knocking the ambiguity out of the term.

00;03;57;21 - 00;04;34;17
Unknown
Some of these things are observed very well and described very well. While presenting UAP as a class of phenomena, Knuth presents a slide of seven UFO images. And yes, my profile image can be seen here. Taken in 2007, in green Bay, Wisconsin. The inclusion of these images is very deliberate, so let's go through the context of each image, and let's knock out the Mosul orb from 2016 and Iraq provided by Jeremy Corbell in Japan, 1943 Foo Fighters as these have been discussed to death, Costa Rica 1971 occurred on the Lago Dakota, Costa Rica.

00;04;34;20 - 00;04;59;29
Unknown
The photo was taken by a government mapping plane during an aerial mapping mission. A high quality photo of this disc was taken from 10,000ft. Interestingly, the four crew did not notice this craft, but locals near the lake reported strange sightings of a disc shaped craft operating around and below the lake's surface. The way Wagga, Wisconsin 2003 image is actually quite disturbing.

00;05;00;03 - 00;05;34;08
Unknown
This image features a disc hovering over trees. According to the photographer's account, she and her son were sledding near dusk when the child pointed to lights in the sky. The photographer quickly snapped three images of the disc as it passed directly overhead, and according to the woman, the lights cycled between different colors. The UFO evidence investigator attempted to contact the photographer for more information, to no avail, but was able to analyze the photo and found no evidence of practical effects or CGI, and noticed compression similar to that of a digital camera.

00;05;34;10 - 00;05;58;16
Unknown
The images, taken from Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada in 2005, highlight a truly anomalous shape, almost dislike, but with complex curves, according to the photographer. The image rob Ahrefs. He was simply taking the images of the China Shipping Lanes vessel and saw no craft, only one. Reviewing his photos on the SD card did he see the presence of the UFO.

00;05;58;18 - 00;06;27;20
Unknown
And now onto my actual profile picture. One of my favorite series of UFO images ever. These images were also taken in Wisconsin, this time in 2007 around green Bay, and looks quite similar to the way a Wagyu UFO with a different light configuration. Of course, there is a noticeable difference in the three triangular lights in the O3 images in a circular pattern of lights as depicted here, but the craft shape, color, and location is almost identical.

00;06;27;22 - 00;06;51;13
Unknown
I don't want to dive too much into this series of images now, as I do plan to explore them further. The three 1958 Trindade, Brazil photographs depict a classic flying disc with sharp edges, not dissimilar to the Calvin photographs. The photos were taken from the vessel Amarante Saldanha by photographer Amuro Burana near the Trinidad island, 600 miles off the Brazilian mainland.

00;06;51;15 - 00;07;20;28
Unknown
Parana, along with many of the other 48 passengers, including Lieutenant Homero, saw the UFO gleaming light fly behind the Sato peak. Seconds later, the craft reversed directions and flew closer and lower at noticeably faster speeds. The object was gray, metallic and solid looking, though surrounded by a greenish haze or mist with a ring running through its midsection. This craft was described as resembling a flattened version of the planet Saturn.

00;07;21;00 - 00;07;53;10
Unknown
Knuth then goes on to reference the five characteristics of UAP or six if you include biological effects, as famously outlined by Lou Elizondo of eight of these five characteristics I like to bring up quite often, and I'm thrilled Kevin mentions them. He pays special attention to the combination of sudden image, instantaneous acceleration, and hypersonic velocities without signatures. To analyze these two characteristics of UAP news references the famous Nimitz encounter when people bring up UAP as foreign technology.

00;07;53;10 - 00;08;26;28
Unknown
I often like to reference this analysis. During the TikToks altitude change from 28,000ft to sea level and roughly 0.78 seconds, the craft experienced an estimated 5400 GS of force. To put this into perspective, a human can handle 16 GS for less than a minute until death and our best ballistic missiles can handle around 100 GS before getting ripped to shreds, a lower bound for the acceleration, which comes out to be around 5000 GS 5000 times acceleration of gravity.

00;08;27;00 - 00;08;54;01
Unknown
No. People aren't going to survive this. Most equipment won't survive this. And F-35'S wings will rip off at about 13 GS to calculate the power of this acceleration, Knuth must have the mass of the TikTok. Of course, he does not have this data, so he takes an extremely conservative approach and estimates the mass of the Tic-Tac to be around one tenth the mass of a similarly sized F-18 at 10,000kg.

00;08;54;03 - 00;09;20;00
Unknown
So for his calculations, he uses 1000kg as the mass of the Tic-Tac. A simple power calculation reminiscent of my college physics days yields an output of 1100GW, ten times the total nuclear output of the United States. The professor then references a lecture made by the German father of modern rocketry, Hermann Oberth, on flying saucers that was completely new to me.

00;09;20;02 - 00;09;52;17
Unknown
For reference, Oberth mentor, Operation Paperclip, scientist and father of NASA Wernher von Braun. In this lecture, Oberth quotes UFO speeds have been clocked in at 19km per second, which is equivalent to 42,000mph or mock 55. Interestingly, Oberth was able to calculate these values based off of 50 cases derived from USAF and U.S. Navy data. This has been known for a long time.

00;09;52;19 - 00;10;23;10
Unknown
Hermann Oberth was the German father of modern rocketry. He was a mentor of Wernher von Braun. In 1954, he gave a lecture on flying saucers, where he pointed out that they have been measured to travel at speeds of 19km a second, which is about 42,000 miles an hour. And he points out that he actually says if there would only be 3 or 4 measurements, I would not rely upon them and would wait for further measurements.

00;10;23;17 - 00;10;49;12
Unknown
But there is existing more than 50 such measurements. Radar measurements in 1954. To add some interest here, in 1954, Oberth wrote in American Weekly quote, it is my thesis that flying saucers are real and that they are spaceships from another solar system. I think that they are possibly manned by intelligent observers, who are members of a race that may have been investigating our Earth for centuries.

00;10;49;15 - 00;11;21;27
Unknown
He thinks that UFOs might fly by, quote, distorting the gravitational field. Kevin then references the flight characteristics of a really under the radar UFO encounter that occurred at Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota in 1968, and what's worthy to note here? Similar to Malmstrom, this air base supported nuclear weapons, another connection to UFOs and nukes. According to base personnel, an egg shaped UFO with skin described as molten lava maintained a distance of roughly three miles from the descending B-52.

00;11;22;00 - 00;11;45;18
Unknown
During a three second radar sweep, the UFO closed a distance of two miles. According to this acceleration, the craft accelerated at 209 GS with a top speed of Mach 12 or 90 200mph. This case is absurdly interesting, and something I may cover fully in the future, as the egg shaped craft with the skin like lava sounds awfully familiar to.

00;11;45;20 - 00;12;15;23
Unknown
Wiggins described crash of an egg shaped craft with the skin exhibiting the mother of pearl effect. Does it not? Also, I talk often about USAF regulation 200 Dash two, implemented in 1953 to restrict UFO reporting and to essentially keep any reports from being disclosed to Bluebook, Congress and the American people. Well, the declassified sighting of the mint report shows this case was reported under regulation 200 dash two.

00;12;15;26 - 00;12;38;04
Unknown
Interesting to see how this case never made it into Bluebook files or real public awareness, but is a multicenter military detection of a UFO at a nuclear military base? And guys, I already covered the 1986 Japan Airlines incident pretty in-depth in my iceberg layer too. So if you don't mind, I'll just overlay some of that footage here. It's one of my absolute favorite UFO cases.

00;12;38;04 - 00;13;14;08
Unknown
But please remember this news calculates the speed of the craft. Reach around 269,000mph at around 5 p.m. on November 17th, 1986, Captain Teriyaki and two crew claimed to see a UFO approached their plane, traveling at 35,000ft from the left. What they saw and described was one large, round, earth sized UFO the size of an aircraft carrier. To put this into perspective, about four 747 in diameter.

00;13;14;11 - 00;13;47;24
Unknown
Accompanying this enormous craft were two smaller lights, and the three followed this Boeing 747 for a period of 31 minutes. While traveling at cruising speed. Captain Kendrew said the mothership maintained a distance of about 7.5 miles from his aircraft, but was essentially orbiting around his aircraft in a circular motion, sometimes at a constant fixed speeds, sometimes darting in and out around its orbit.

00;13;47;26 - 00;14;23;04
Unknown
It's worth mentioning that these UFOs were tracked on the US Federal Aviation Administration and 117 long range 3D phased arrays. The radar confirmed the UFO stayed about 7.5 miles in radius from the aircraft, maintaining that distance but occasionally changing sides during the radar's 12 second interval sweeps. These exhibited extreme accelerations. They've been tracked at hypersonic speeds and air many times.

00;14;23;06 - 00;14;46;01
Unknown
Where they do not make running off the bottom of the screen. They don't make sonic booms or fireballs, which you would expect. So something very strange was going on and one thing that's almost never mentioned is there's no energy deposition when they stop, this thing drops from 28,000ft to sea level, getting up to about 42,000 miles an hour in the middle and then stops.

00;14;46;03 - 00;15;11;15
Unknown
Where did all that energy go? Well, you know, first you worry about where it came from, but where did it go? Energy doesn't just disappear when this thing comes to a stop. There ought to have been an explosion. And given the amount of power that it took, you can estimate how big that would have been. Should have been an explosion about with about to the same amount of energy as 250, Tomahawk cruise missiles simultaneously blowing.

00;15;11;18 - 00;15;49;29
Unknown
The professor then references the consequences of these drastic accelerations to show that under such extreme rates of constant acceleration, these craft could reach high percentages of the speed of light to traverse intergalactic space at relativistic speeds. Crucially quoted by Knuth. Quote. Not only do these objects have flight characteristics necessary for interstellar travel, they would make excellent interstellar craft, and with available data, not only can the physics of UFOs be analyzed, but the luminosity to Kevin attests to the luminosity of some UFOs attributed to their low visibility.

00;15;49;29 - 00;16;20;26
Unknown
From photographs. Here, he references three bright UFO sightings. The luminosity of these objects can be calculated like in the Canadian Air Force. August 1953 sighting by Doctor Bruce Maccabee and then also summarized and reported by by Zhang Phil, a doctor of L.A. and if you they were able to look at the the original the original photograph and measure the exposure level.

00;16;20;28 - 00;16;56;26
Unknown
And if you do this, you find that the luminosities are on the order of 2000 to 30,000MW. Knuth suggests this massive luminosity output may, in fact, be a byproduct of the propulsion systems of these craft. And let's remember, in many UFO cases, electronics fail when in close proximity to a craft. This suggests the presence of electric and magnetic fields, such as the case in the 1976 Tehran incident, where major Jeffery's avionics were scrambled as an orb detached itself from the UAP, he was vector towards and near him.

00;16;56;28 - 00;17;23;27
Unknown
Many other cases see engines and cars fail. As such, the 1983 Mike Campbell case electric fields needed to short out spark plugs on an engine would require a field output of three times ten to the 6V/m, possibly ionizing the air that'll short out the spark plugs in the car. You know, short out the distributor cam so the car would stop running.

00;17;23;29 - 00;17;58;25
Unknown
If it's a gasoline engine, this electric field emitted by a small UFO would require several coulombs of charge, equating to about ten to the ninth joules of energy. This additionally touches on magnetic fields created by UFO. These huge magnetic fields can create and can cause and effect called the Faraday effect, which rotates the polarization of the light. So if you take a photograph of a UFO with a polarizing filter, which I recommend for this reason, you will see, that you'll get rings around the UFO if it has a large magnetic field.

00;17;58;28 - 00;18;23;15
Unknown
This has been observed and it's been photographed resulting in fields on the magnitude of around ten to the 11th through ten to the 13 amp meter squared, aka hey guys, massive magnetic fields. And finally, one of the least represented aspects of UFO or should I say USO. Unidentified Submerged Objects Kevin dives into Uso's operating near and within water.

00;18;23;17 - 00;18;43;13
Unknown
So this is a from Aqua. Yeah, you can see the UFO dips into the water. Doesn't make a splash, doesn't seem to affect the water very much. And in fact, the analysis done by Sue in the lower right shows that as the UFO hits the water at about 1000 miles an hour or a thousand, I'm sorry, a hundred miles an hour.

00;18;43;16 - 00;19;25;13
Unknown
It continues, traveling through the water at around the same speed. It only drops down to about 85 miles an hour, and it actually accelerates its you. References radar operator and seaman David Barnett, the professor discusses a USO case brand new to me from February of 1987 near the north of New Zealand. In this case, the Hmnzs Southland was followed by a USO 150ft wide and 800ft long in the span of less than half a minute, the USO closed a 20 kilometer distance, estimated a minimum speed and acceleration of 1492mph, and an average of 4.5 GS.

00;19;25;16 - 00;19;52;03
Unknown
Noteworthy to add, the craft acted as if it did not interact with the water. Similar to the video, Kevin commented on closing the 20 kilometer distance. The USO passed under the HMS, killing all the ship's power and draining batteries. Kevin enlists a total of eight old cases in which trans medical air and water UFOs were observed. Not going to cover this now, but let me know if you would like a full video on these cases.

00;19;52;06 - 00;20;15;15
Unknown
Hey guys, it's UAP Group. Thank you so much for joining me today. You probably noticed a little bit of a different environment. I'm in the process of upgrading the setup, so bear with me while we get a new webcam and a new workspace to show off and kind of upgrade things a little bit. Thanks for joining me. As we discussed Kevin Knuth and his solo Foundation talk in his paper Estimating Flight Characteristics of Anomalous Unidentified Aerial Vehicles.

00;20;15;17 - 00;20;34;22
Unknown
Truth be told, since this paper dropped in 2019, I have been infatuated with the data here, even reaching out to Kevin on LinkedIn asking if I could work for him. Of course didn't pan out, but maybe someday in the future. But just being able to visualize the G-forces experienced by things like the Nimitz, Tic TAC, and so forth is truly mind boggling.

00;20;34;22 - 00;21;05;04
Unknown
And actually, as we start to put some calculations and data to these craft, instead of just the anomalous craft in their kind of characteristics, as proposed by Lou Elizondo. But a fascinating venture and presentation done by Knuth. What was your favorite case? He discussed probably the Nimitz 5400 GS or the Japan Airlines. But I'm just really impressed that Kevin Booth and some physicists actually take the time to do academic research on UAP at some point in the future.

00;21;05;04 - 00;21;28;01
Unknown
I want to do a video on the trans medium craft, as he discussed the eight cases that are pre basically World War two. That should be a really fascinating video. And whenever people like to say that UAP are just foreign adversaries technology. Look what Kevin's proposed. These cases have been occurring since the 20th century. And almost before. How is this technology possible then if it's a foreign adversary?

00;21;28;01 - 00;21;34;15
Unknown
Absolutely not. But anyway, guys, please remember to like and subscribe. I'll catch you guys on the next video. Thank you so much for joining. Bye.
