# FASTWALKERS – UFOs Outside Earth

## Description
Exploring the term "Fastwalkers," used to describe UFOs detected entering or leaving Earth's atmosphere. The terms "Fastwalker" and "Slowwalker" have been utilized by [[USNORTHCOM]] and [[NORAD]] to avoid declassification through FOIA requests. This video covers three cases where [[NORAD]], [[Space Force]], and the USG denied access to Fastwalker-related data. 

Additionally, the infamous [[J. Allen Hynek]] exposed [[NORAD]]'s UAP interest in the 1960s. [[Fastwalkers]] also appeared in the 2016 [[Hillary Clinton]] email leaks, revealing discussions between [[John Podesta]] and [[Bob Fish]] regarding the [[Defense Support Program]]'s role in monitoring UAP. We also examine two cases: a UFO performing impossible maneuvers in space and another linked to the [[1976 Tehran UFO incident]].

Finally, we connect Fastwalker research to the [[Aerospace Corporation]], an organization linked to "real" UAP research as suggested by [[Jacques Vallée]] and [[Ross Coulthart]].

What if I told you the terms we use every single day? UFO and UAP are limited and only paint part of the picture. According to the US government. Would you be surprised to learn that UFO, UAP encompass only phenomena and trans medial craft operating within Earth's atmosphere and under the planet's oceans? In fact, the USG, particularly North Brad in the US Space Force, have an entirely different designation for UFOs entering or leaving Earth's atmosphere.

00;00;31;13 - 00;00;59;24
Unknown
Fast walkers and slow walkers. Hey guys, it's UAP Group! I'm back. And as always, thank you for returning to the channel. Today we are going to go down the deep rabbit hole of space bound UFOs known as Fast Walkers. Two little. The question is asked how often are UFOs observed in outer space? Well, the USG is clearly concerned about this question and has a storied history of investigating fast walkers.

00;00;59;27 - 00;01;32;18
Unknown
So let's get some terms out of the way. And again, remember there is a distinction here from UFO. The Walker callsign describes objects entering or leaving Earth's atmosphere at variable speeds. Slow walker for low velocity objects and fast walkers. Well, you guys can probably guess today we are only going to focus on the latter the fast walker. This distinction is crucial as during an age of increasing, albeit surface level UFO transparency, it allows the USG to avoid declassification.

00;01;32;21 - 00;02;01;21
Unknown
Freedom of Information Act requests for fast walkers and slow walkers. In late 2023, John Greenwald of the Black Vault received a decisive and final response to his countless FOIA requests on the term fast walkers and slow walkers. This response came from the US Space Force, the famed USAF Space Division. With this request, Greenwald sought any reports, information detailed military info on this topic.

00;02;01;24 - 00;02;27;11
Unknown
In response, Space Force issued a full denial to divulge any material under FOIA, citing exception one as a denial to disclose which states quote under criteria established by an executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy. But curiously, this wasn't actually the first time Greenwald was denied access to any information on Fast Walker.

00;02;27;13 - 00;03;03;12
Unknown
Ten years earlier, in 2013, Greenwald submitted a similar request, which was handled by U.S. Northcom the United States Northern Command, which oversees Nor at the North American Aerospace Defense Command. Nor is headquartered at Space Force Base in Colorado. I know this doesn't seem very important now, but keep Nora in mind. Anyways, Northcom and Nora had responded to Greenwald stating fast Walker documentation is, quote, currently and properly classified again by Executive Order 13526.

00;03;03;12 - 00;03;38;26
Unknown
Quote considered critical to national defense or foreign policy, and is thus controlled by the US government. But there were two documents that were provided to Greenwald. One, a paper titled Orbit Determined Nation of Sunlit Illuminated Objects Detected by Overhead Platforms from 1989, and space based Satellite tracking and Characterization utilizing non imaging passive sensors from 2008, but nor AD's refusal to share any data on fast walkers or UFO tracking data doesn't start with Greenwald.

00;03;38;28 - 00;04;05;00
Unknown
Check this out. This is an extremely interesting excerpt from the book Clear Intent. The Government Coverup of the UFO experience by authors Barry J. Greenwood and Lawrence Fawcett. This book contains both a section of the scanned Nor add UAP reporting sheet, but also a chapters on UFOs and FOIA. The Freedom of Information Act within this chapter is a request to narrate for UAP tracking data.

00;04;05;02 - 00;04;34;17
Unknown
To which Nora replies, will require over 18,000 man hours and a cost of $155,000 at the time. In 1979, which would equate to well over half 1 million USD today. Nora also refused to waive the fees on a follow up request three years later. So let's use the documents provided to Greenwald to get a jump start on fast walkers and utilize any other clues to try and learn more about them.

00;04;34;20 - 00;05;13;18
Unknown
We can trace this Fast Walker designation to originate with Nora at utilized to detect objects entering or leaving atmosphere. As I mentioned above, at significant speeds by US defense systems. The first of the two documents, the one on orbit determination of sunlit illuminated Objects, was written by USAF Captain Richard Postdocs, and this details the joint efforts of Nora and the Air Force Foreign Technology Division to investigate UN cataloged space bound objects detected by reflected sunlight passing through satellite sensors designated as fast walkers.

00;05;13;20 - 00;05;53;18
Unknown
This document states that the data on these objects has been recorded since 1972 by, quote, certain ballistic missile early warning satellite systems located at various geostationary locations. And also this paper sought to determine orbit or motion of these objects, but was deemed unsolvable by former efforts by one researcher, Wong, as mentioned. Shockingly, the report states the fast walker analysis has become an increasingly important issue due to the increase in geosynchronous satellites which detect the objects while ground based sensors cannot.

00;05;53;21 - 00;06;22;23
Unknown
So very important here, we can assume the increase in detection and database built in 72 is a result of the Defense Support Program. The DSP served and serves currently as the US's primary ballistic missile entry warning system, and its first satellite, DSP one, went into orbit in 1970. Additionally, DSP information is relayed to Noor AD and remember DSP is now a part of the US Space Force.

00;06;22;25 - 00;06;49;10
Unknown
Our second paper on space based satellite tracking was written by Captain Bradley R Townsend and the Air Force Institute of Technology out of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and sought to revisit to determine the orbit or movement of fast walkers. Again, quote satellite based sensors looking down at the Earth's surface occasionally observed reflected light from an object passing through the image, which is moving too fast.

00;06;49;10 - 00;07;14;28
Unknown
Relative to the background of the image to be located within the atmosphere. These objects are commonly called fast walkers. This study comments on the 1972 Office of Act study, and referred to the database origin from obtained ballistic missile entry warning satellites. Not much else to cover here. Our study methods yield similar results with an inability to determine range to fast walker targets.

00;07;15;00 - 00;07;42;14
Unknown
But remember again that the ballistic missile warning satellites are mentioned here again. DSP the Defense Support Program our trail with fast walkers Nusrat and DSP ballistic warning detection satellites doesn't stop with these two documents, however. For example, on the 6th of January 1967, Scientific Advisor to Project Bluebook Jay Allen Hynek. I talked about him extensively in many videos like my history on the UFO stigma.

00;07;42;15 - 00;08;09;13
Unknown
Check that out. Discussed at Goddard Space Flight Center that Nora Ed tracks UFOs and has been since 1957, and that every single continental U.S. military UFO case and blue Book files are designated as a Nora case. And does anyone remember the Hillary Clinton campaign leaks provided by Wikileaks? This is where a rabbit hole gets wild. Well, pouring through them.

00;08;09;13 - 00;08;36;23
Unknown
You can find an incredibly interesting email chain to Clinton campaign manager John Podesta on this email. From March of 2015, there is a detailed communication between USG contractor Bob Fish and Podesta. Fish was the program manager for several highly classified U.S. government advanced communication systems projects in the 1980s and 1990s. These included the white House and several executive branch intelligence agencies.

00;08;36;27 - 00;09;01;05
Unknown
And for what it's worth, just a side note Bob himself was vetted by Ross Colbert. But anyways, fish makes an immediate and direct claim that, quote, one of the government programs that collects hard data on unidentified flying objects is the USAF DSP satellite program. In fact, the main body of this email is so interesting I may as well quote the whole thing.

00;09;01;11 - 00;09;22;29
Unknown
Quote I can add a little insight to rumors published on the web. While I was never fully briefed into the DSP operation directly. I was introduced to them as the U.S. prepared for Operation Desert Shield and Desert Storm. On occasion, I had lunch with a few of them in the cafeteria of a highly classified organization in El Segundo, California.

00;09;23;03 - 00;09;51;12
Unknown
No one could get into the cafeteria without C.I. clearance, so this was not a lightweight group of gossipers. One of these times, a member of that group was really excited. Said they just picked up a fast walker. I assume that same day he described how it entered our atmosphere from deep space origin actually unknown. But of course from the backside of the satellite and zipped by the DSP satellite pretty closely on its way to Earth.

00;09;51;14 - 00;10;17;25
Unknown
Not only was it going very fast, but it made a 30 degree course correction turn, which means it did not have a ballistic freefall reentry trajectory that a meteorite might have. So it was under some sort of control, although whether it was manned or just robotic, there's no way to tell. Towards the end of the email, Bob references a line in the 2014 Defense Support Program Fact sheet to support the idea.

00;10;17;25 - 00;10;52;17
Unknown
The DSP is still collecting Fast Walker data 24 years later. In addition, researchers at the Aerospace Corporation have used DSP to develop portions of a hazard support system that will aid public safety in the future. Remember this line and remember the mention by DSP itself of the Aerospace Corporation. Fish also links to a strange, now defunct blog, which I've accessed via the web archives, titled Top Secret Spy Satellite Spot UFOs by Tim Schwartz.

00;10;52;19 - 00;11;20;06
Unknown
Fish strangely comments that much of the information on this site is correct, but where else can we connect DSP and fast walkers? Let's visit a case from the 5th of May 1984, an anonymous source claims to a journalist named Joe Stifler, a former Army Criminal Investigation Command, that a highly classified U.S. Defense Support Program spy satellite detected a UAP.

00;11;20;08 - 00;11;53;14
Unknown
It comes within 1.8 miles of the DSP satellite before flying below it over the Indian Ocean. It is moving 22,000mph, changes course, and allegedly flies back into outer space. Since this case is so old and there is so little published about it, tracking this down has been an absolute bear. But I have been able to find two now destroyed sites on this article, and by the way, does this case not sound very similar to the incident Phish was describing to Podesta?

00;11;53;16 - 00;12;25;23
Unknown
Anyways, both sites state quote this object was first spotted by the ultra sensitive orbiting USD esp satellite our country uses for detailed surveillance and air defense. These satellites have the infrared capacity to spot small heat sources on the surface of the Earth, and our time proven as effective monitoring devices and quote which this lines up with the 1972 paper where the DSP satellites monitor small light or heat reflections off of fast walkers.

00;12;25;26 - 00;12;53;26
Unknown
This ancient blog, Deb's UFO research, provides an interesting depiction of the event through three images. Image one shows the DSP one satellite. Image two shows the fast walker headed left to right towards Earth, and image three depicts the reversal of the fast walker as it retreats back to open space. This site also provides an image of the trajectory of the Fast Walker by Stifler himself, and states quote.

00;12;53;28 - 00;13;24;06
Unknown
An object was spotted by a US DSP satellite and tracked as it sped first directly toward the Earth and passed in front and within 15 miles of the US DSP satellite. It suddenly and without impact or contact with other devices or obstructions, curved outward away from the Earth. It was tracked for another nine minutes until it disappeared and additionally, the site publishes a recreation or possibly an image of the top secret incident.

00;13;24;06 - 00;13;57;19
Unknown
Report summary. See the incident underlined. I am still unclear on terminology here, such as the UCF listing and the T in the field of view. If you can identify these terms to help decipher this image, please let me know and maybe we can work together on a follow up to this case. Whilst the Fuller States quote have been able to confirm that the DSP printout for that date shows an event at the same time with the same characteristics and quote, we cannot use this evidence to prove or deny this case a story and records as true or false.

00;13;57;19 - 00;14;24;12
Unknown
Concretely, until we can do a full analysis on an entire DSP report. This case remains speculative. Our next case, with ties to the DSP and fast walkers will actually be familiar to fans of my channel, yet will likely shock you. The 1976 Tehran UFO encounter. For those of you who have not seen my first grounded flight due to UFOs video, I recommend checking that out.

00;14;24;14 - 00;14;56;13
Unknown
But here's a clip on one of my all time favorite UFO encounters. Imagine when I was looking here at about 70 miles out and we jumped all of a sudden ten degrees to my right. In this angle, ten degrees. This part it was traveling becomes about 26.7 miles per moment. I don't say per second, maybe, maybe less than a second.

00;14;56;15 - 00;15;31;13
Unknown
The link to Fast Walker was done by researchers Lee Graham and Roger Rieger, satellite sensor technicians at Aero Jet in California. They themselves confirm that the UFO sighting over Tehran was in fact tracked by the United States military DSP satellite. During their investigations, Graham and Rieger located a computer printout from the time frame of the Iranian UFO overflight, which shows that the DSP satellite definitely detected a, quote, anomalous object in Iranian airspace.

00;15;31;15 - 00;15;55;10
Unknown
After a long and fruitless venture to confirm these claims, finding nothing besides a declassified paper often referenced by Rieger titled Now You See It, now you don't buy Yusuf captain Harry s shield. I was finally able to begin to pull on the strings of the evidence. Graham and Rieger proposed within the nightcap report of the 1976 Tehran incident.

00;15;55;12 - 00;16;39;19
Unknown
There exists a link to a long dead email chain between Brad Sparks, an early founder of CIA, US, the Citizens Against UFO secrecy, and blog owner RJ Cohen. Here, Brad raises concerns about DSP one detecting the UFO in the 76 case and questioning whether the satellite actually captured the Mirage Airforce or scrambled to pursue the UFOs instead. Spark references a quote out of focus, graphic image and quote that only gives the date not time of the event, and states quote 238 scans possible S.R. since DSP scans once every 10s.

00;16;39;19 - 00;17;09;29
Unknown
This means that DSP scanned an object for 39.7 minutes, and the short term listed may refer to. Strategic reconnaissance. After going deeper, I was able to find an email chain from the now also defunct Virtually Strange Darknet dating back to 1998, which references the DSP connection and the 1976 Tehran case. This email states, quote Jpeg is available at the above URL and quote.

00;17;10;01 - 00;17;35;05
Unknown
So at this point I was finally getting close to finding the actual image. Following the source of the Jpeg takes us to a 1997 blog post on UFO World Simple Netcom titled quote the DSP connection. And here we get the out-of-focus, grainy image that supposedly depicts the DSP printouts highlighting the 1976 Tehran Fast Walker by Graham and Riga guys.

00;17;35;08 - 00;18;03;24
Unknown
The only things we can determine from this raw image is a similar to structure to the 1984 Fast Walker case, where the term ukf is referenced multiple times as well, and the aforementioned 238 scans possible SR. The rest of the image is illegible and frustrating due to my limited graphic experience. I have tried and failed to. I upscale this image to make the rest of the text legible.

00;18;03;26 - 00;18;29;20
Unknown
Also, my backwards image search yielded zero results. If you think you can help me make this document legible, please, please, please email me at UAP Group at gmail.com and let's figure this case out together. So there we have it. Two cases connecting fast walkers and DSP, but both lead us to somewhat dead ends with insufficient data to further investigation.

00;18;29;22 - 00;18;53;24
Unknown
I am going to keep getting to the bottom of this. Hopefully with one of you, but let's get some updates relevant updates to these cases soon. So remember back how Phish mentioned at the end of the 2014 DSP Fact sheet? Quote. In addition, researchers at the Aerospace Corporation have used DSP to develop portions of a hazard support system that will aid public safety in the future.

00;18;53;27 - 00;19;31;17
Unknown
Well, guys, the Aerospace Corporation is suspected as one of the legacy private corporations who engage in, quote, real UAP research in ufologist Jack Phillips book Hidden Science five, which accounts for Val's journals from 2000 to 2009. He, along with Kitt Green, physicist Hal, put off astrophysicist Eric Davis and Christine B Zimmerman, suspect that Aerospace Corporation, alongside Lockheed, Raytheon, and Northrop Grumman, are among the USG contractors involved with deep UFO work.

00;19;31;20 - 00;19;58;12
Unknown
And in Ross quote, Hart's fantastic book In Plain Sight. I would highly recommend reading that book. He writes that a source told him about an aerospace company in Long Beach, California, with access to, quote, the wreckage. The source told Ross, quote, the program was controlled by a relatively small group of people, not all in government, including people in aerospace, intelligence and corporate financial communities.

00;19;58;15 - 00;20;42;18
Unknown
The source said that the company had sprawling gardens and the only major aerospace company in Long Beach, California, that has this type of campus is the Aerospace Corporation. And remember, Colt Hart is no slouch. He is the man, after all, who broke the story. And there is much more work to be done. Investigate the aerospace Corporation. That is not the subject of this video, but it is interesting to see how Space Force and DSP would be analyzing DSB data with the Aerospace Corporation, a company with possible larger ties to covert UAP study, to, quote, develop portions of a hazard support system that will aid public safety in the future.

00;20;42;21 - 00;21;06;11
Unknown
Hey, guys. Thank you so much for joining me today. I know it just feels like we started to scratch the surface of fast walkers and space bound UAP, but I wanted to make this video for a brief look into kind of how Space Force, USG, DoD, no rad kind of use the terminology of Fast Walker to skirt around phobia and how this isn't a new term.

00;21;06;11 - 00;21;29;04
Unknown
And we can trace back to the 76 I ran case, the 1984 DSP one case to, you know, possibly lead some evidence to early fast walker detection. Those two cases are of extreme interest to me. And if you think you can help me out, decipher that terminology, find out where those images were actually sourced from or I upscale them to help me figure out what the heck they are saying.

00;21;29;04 - 00;21;56;01
Unknown
Please again, contact me at UAP group@gmail.com, and I hope you found that Lee m gram pretty interesting. I've actually tried to connect with him on Facebook and so that is pending. I'd like to hear more about his research into this case and there's actually a lot of interesting things surrounding gram and some claims he made. I've heard some people liken him to, a similar person to a 1980s UFO whistleblower.

00;21;56;01 - 00;22;15;28
Unknown
So should be some exciting stuff on that if I can actually get in contact with him. Guys, please remember if you enjoyed the video to like or subscribe and leave a comment. What you think about DSP, fast walkers, space bound, UAP and so forth. Thank you guys so much for joining and as always, I will catch you for the next video.
