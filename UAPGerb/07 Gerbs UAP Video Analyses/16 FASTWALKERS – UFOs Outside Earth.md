# FASTWALKERS ‚Äì UFOs Outside Earth

## Description
Exploring the term "Fastwalkers," used to describe UFOs detected entering or leaving Earth's atmosphere. The terms "Fastwalker" and "Slowwalker" have been utilized by [[USNORTHCOM]] and [[NORAD]] to avoid declassification through FOIA requests. This video covers three cases where [[NORAD]], [[Space Force]], and the USG denied access to Fastwalker-related data. 

Additionally, the infamous [[J. Allen Hynek]] exposed [[NORAD]]'s UAP interest in the 1960s. [[Fastwalkers]] also appeared in the 2016 [[Hillary Clinton]] email leaks, revealing discussions between [[John Podesta]] and [[Bob Fish]] regarding the [[Defense Support Program]]'s role in monitoring UAP. We also examine two cases: a UFO performing impossible maneuvers in space and another linked to the [[1976 Tehran UFO incident]].

Finally, we connect Fastwalker research to the [[Aerospace Corporation]], an organization linked to "real" UAP research as suggested by [[Jacques Vall√©e]] and [[Ross Coulthart]].
