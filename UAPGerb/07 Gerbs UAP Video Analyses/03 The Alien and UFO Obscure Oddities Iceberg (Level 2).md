### Introduction
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm back. Like a boomerang. I am your host, UAP Gerb. And I'd like to welcome you to the second episode of the alien and UFO obscure Oddities iceberg. 

If you missed level one, I recommend checking that out. First, I will put the video link in the video description. Join me as we tackle layer two. Today we're going to have some strange UFO cases.

00;00;23;13 - 00;00;42;18
Gerb
We're going to have some weird stuff. We're going to have some sightings that I don't necessarily care for. And I'm going to tell you when I don't like the entry, but we are going to call this layer the Enjoyer. Before we get into everything, please consider liking and subscribing. The first two videos on my channel have done very well and I'm very happy about that.

00;00;42;21 - 00;01;11;13
Gerb
I plan to finish up this iceberg and then move back to some interesting documentaries. I did a poll and it looks like some people want to see UAPs in the private sector. So boy do I have some good stuff to touch on for that. So join me as we tackle the Enjoyer layer of the alien and UFO obscure oddities iceberg.

### [[1986 Japan Airlines Cargo Flight 1628 Incident|Japan Airlines Cargo Flight 1628 Incident]]
Japan Airlines Cargo Flights 1628 incident I am thrilled we get to talk about this.

00;01;11;13 - 00;01;40;16
Gerb
This is one of my all time favorite UFO cases, and I think it is severely underrated and underrepresented when talking about the phenomena. Before we get started, just know that Aviation Week and Space Technology magazine introduced this as the explanation for the sighting, and it caught on. And people think this is the proper explanation to this case, that what the pilot I'm going to talk about saw were Mars and Jupiter.

00;01;40;18 - 00;02;14;15
Gerb
Okay, so let's join Captain [[Kenji Terauchi]] in his Boeing 747 200 F in his cargo flight from France to Tokyo on the Reykjavik to Anchorage leg. At around 5 p.m. on November 17th, 1986, Captain Terauchi and two crew claimed to see a UFO approached their plane, traveling at 35,000ft from the left. What they saw and described was one large, rounder sized UFO the size of an aircraft carrier.

00;02;14;18 - 00;02;52;24
Gerb
To put this into perspective, about four 747 in diameter. Accompanying this enormous craft were two smaller lights, and the three followed this Boeing 747 for a period of 31 minutes. While traveling at cruising speed. Captain Kenji said the mothership maintained a distance of about 7.5 miles from his aircraft, but was essentially orbiting around his aircraft in a circular motion, sometimes at a constant fixed speeds, sometimes darting in and out around its orbit.

00;02;52;27 - 00;03;38;24
Gerb
It's worth mentioning that these UFOs were tracked on US Federal Aviation Administration [[ANFPS117 long range 3D phased arrays]]. The radar confirmed the UFO stayed about 7.5 miles in radius from the aircraft, maintaining that distance but occasionally changing sides during the radar's 12 second interval sweeps. Now, what interests me the most about this case is New York University physics professor [[Kevin Knuth]] published an article called [[Estimating Flight Characteristics of Anomalous Unidentified Aerial Vehicles]], in which he tackles a couple famous UFO credible UFO cases throughout history.

00;03;39;01 - 00;04;12;04
Gerb
This 1986 incident being one of them. As you'll see in the figure on screen, Knuth modeled the UAPs G-Force that experienced during this circular motion around the craft. If the UAP traveled across the diameter of the circle, it was subject to 68 plus or minus seven G's. If the UAP moved in a circular motion focusing on only the centripetal acceleration, the craft experienced 84 plus or minus eight g's.

00;04;12;10 - 00;04;46;29
Gerb
This is substantial. To put this into perspective, this is an incredibly high G-Force sustained for 31 minutes. This amount of G's experienced by a human would kill them and be fatal extremely fast. In fact, nine G's is the limit a trained pilot can handle during a sustained turn and a sustained turn means a minute, not 30 minutes. 

### Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
[[Wright-Patterson AFB|Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]].

00;04;47;01 - 00;05;20;15
Gerb
I actually don't know how much I want to go into Wright-Pat right now, because I would actually like to make a couple videos on this, but essentially, [[Wright-Patterson AFB|Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]] has deep ties to ufology, crash retrieval, and reverse engineering, dating back all the way to July 5th of 1947, where it is said that debris and bodies were shipped out of hangar 84 in Roswell, New Mexico, to [[Wright-Patterson AFB|Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]].

00;05;20;17 - 00;06;01;00
Gerb
So I'm just going to give a little tease where Wright-Pat can be connected to the UFO phenomena. We can look at 1949 through 1955, where Wright-Pat and [[Battelle Memorial Institute|Battelle]] performed special metallurgical analysis on anomalous materials. We can look at [[Lockheed Martin]] Skunkworks director [[Ben Rich]], where in 1993, at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Rich gave a presentation stating, quote, 

"we already have the means to travel among the stars, but these technologies are locked up in the black projects, and it would take an act of God to ever get them out to benefit humanity and anything that you can imagine, we already know how to do."

End quote.

00;06;01;06 - 00;06;34;08
Gerb
What about the 24th of January, 1956, where Wright-Pat monitored a reported landing of a flying saucer in the [[1956 Kataghan Afghanistan|Kataghan Province of Afghanistan]]? USAF attempted to perform an aerial view to determine if authorities were hauling recovered craft to Kabul, Afghanistan. How about the 28th of December 1973, where Senator [[Barry Goldwater]] is denied access to UAP information at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]]?

00;06;34;16 - 00;07;14;26
Gerb
When specifically asking about a quote, "room" and quote where "it" was stored. Goldwater stated he was scolded by Yousuf General [[Curtis LeMay]] and said, quote, "don't ever ask me that question again" end quote. 
And finally, we can look at 2023 and 2024 with the groundbreaking legislation proposed by [[Chuck Schumer]] of the [[2024 NDAA]], UAP Defense Authorization Act, where it's required that all legacy programs and any sort of programs studying UAP or in possession of UAP, divulge their materials and findings.

00;07;14;29 - 00;07;37;24
Gerb
And guess who the biggest proponent of blocking the amendment is? Representative [[Mike Turner]] of Ohio, the same district that represents [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]]. Now, these are just a couple examples of Wright-Pat being connected that the phenomena I have 5 to 10 more I could go over right now. But as an iceberg we're just supposed to give a quick summary of these topics, I got a lot more on this.

00;07;37;24 - 00;08;08;17
Gerb

### Dyson Sphere
[[Dyson Sphere]]. Now remember in video one, we discussed a Kardishev civilization, specifically a type two Kardishev civilization that is able to harness the entire energy output of its host star. While a Dyson sphere is a theoretical device that enables a civilization to do just this. A Dyson sphere is a megastructure dreamt up by scientist [[Freeman Dyson]].

00;08;08;19 - 00;08;39;29
Gerb
The purpose of the Dyson sphere is to entirely encompass a host civilization star. Drawing energy through solar means through fusion. Not quite sure how. So a lot of theory still on a Dyson sphere, but a large outer shell of a sun essentially. And as limited as it is [[SETI]], the search for extraterrestrial intelligence has begun looking at stars for signs of Dyson spheres, for signs of an advanced civilization.

00;08;40;01 - 00;09;14;18
Gerb
Now, the feasibility of creating a Dyson sphere currently is not necessarily possible with our current engineering capabilities. But interestingly, one feasible way to create one of these megastructures is to utilize [[Von Neumann]] self-replicating probes that would be able to harness precious metals and materials from the asteroid belt and from various meteors and various moons, and be able to self replicate and create this sphere without any direct human hands in the cosmos.

00;09;14;20 - 00;09;43;13
Gerb

### [[1989 Voronezh UFO Incident]]
The Voronezh UFO incident is a famous UFO sighting, an extraterrestrial encounter that occurred in the Soviet Union on September 27th, 1989. Now, I'd actually never heard of this incident, so this has been pretty interesting to read up on. Essentially, what occurred here is a group of boys playing football in a city park, saw a pink glowing object in the sky, followed by a deep red ball about three meters in diameter.

00;09;43;15 - 00;10;14;19
Gerb
The balls circled the football pitch, vanished, and reappeared minutes later, hovering. The children then claimed to have seen a quote "three eyed alien" wearing bronze colored boots with a disc on its chest, about ten feet tall. And I'd like to stress the head was rather smushed onto the shoulders. Exit the object along with a robot. 
It was thought that the children were the only ones claiming to have witnessed the craft an alien.

00;10;14;21 - 00;10;41;02
Gerb
But Lieutenant Sergeant [[Sergei A. Matviyenko]], I'm sorry if I butchered that of the police district. Claim to have seen a, quote "flying body in the sky", end quote. 

Now, it's also worth mentioning that this supposed ten foot tall, strange looking E.T. utilized some sort of firearm to make a 16 year old boy disappear before exiting the area and departing in its craft.

00;10;41;05 - 00;11;15;16
Gerb
Now, the Soviet media TASS went crazy for this incident, reporting on it all across the country. I would like to add a seen as this, event occurred in 1989. This was during Gorbachev's tenure as the leader of the Soviet Union. So his move to a more free market economy allowed for a more freedom of press. So you got to think that possibly because the press was finally able to comment and report on things that weren't directly mandated by the Soviet Union, they might have gone a little tabloidey with this story.

00;11;15;18 - 00;11;41;09
Gerb
But anyways, the Soviet's Scientific Commission ordered an official inquiry into the incident. They were not able to find any concrete proof of a craft landing, although radioactive cesium was found in the region, there was not enough to indicate a craft landing. And upon checking for microorganisms and spectral chemical measurements, nothing abnormal was uncovered. So I don't know what happened.

00;11;41;10 - 00;12;22;10
Gerb
It's an interesting looking ET, but I'm not quite sure if I believe the validity of this case.

### J. Allen Hynek
[[J. Allen Hynek]]. Fantastic entry. And this is the man featured in the overview of this iceberg tier. 

[[J. Allen Hynek]] was the scientific advisor to [[Project Bluebook]], the United States government's official investigation into UAP from 1952 to 1969. This was the most well known USG, USAF, UAP investigation study and Bluebook was founded to determine if UFOs were a national security threat and to scientifically analyze UFO data.

00;12;22;12 - 00;12;52;12
Gerb
It's worth mentioning that during its tenure from 52 to 69, 12,618 UFO reports were analyzed, 701 of which were classified as unexplained after extensive analysis. 

Bluebook is a bit controversial due to the [[Robertson Panel]] that occurred in 1953, which was used to strip UFOs of their special status and suggest that no legitimate evidence of their existence was available.

00;12;52;14 - 00;13;22;27
Gerb
Think of the swamp gas and weather balloon explanation and stigma around UFOs. A lot of this came from [[Project Bluebook]], not to mention the [[Condon Report]] that we mentioned in the first video that essentially did the same thing as the [[Robertson Panel]]. All this occurred during Blue Book's tenure. Now back to Hynek. 

In May of 1972, Hynek wrote a book and claimed that Bluebook was, quote, a cover up and that the UFO issue was, quote, "glossed over."

00;13;23;00 - 00;13;51;13
Gerb
He says that Bluebook was a front for a more classified investigation group, possibly something called [[AFOIN-X SG]], and was told to drop certain cases and, quote, "not to pursue the matter further." End quote. 

In 1979, Hynek stated that the CIA's [[Robertson Panel]] was concerned on public reaction to UFOs. They were quote handed down the unwritten law of the Air Force.

00;13;51;14 - 00;14;24;02
Gerb
Don't rock the boat. Play with it. Cool it. Don't get the public excited. 

Hynek stated that Yusuf purposefully debunked interesting cases as balloons or planets. Just think about the [[1986 Japan Airlines Cargo Flight 1628 Incident|Japan Cargo Airlines incident]]. Hynek would also go on to comment on the [[Condon Report]], saying that the committee ignored key evidence. 

What's really crazy is on the 13th of April, 1975, Hynek was told by [[Donald Rumsfeld]] at the white House that he did not have a need to know if there was a secret UAP study somewhere After Bluebook.

00;14;24;02 - 00;14;56;10
Gerb
Hynek would be extremely outspoken about the USGS official UAP investigation, even commenting on 1949 [[Project Grudge]]. One of the predecessors to Blue Book, saying that grudge was, quote, "less scientific and more of a public relations campaign", end quote. Hynek is one of the OG whistleblowers, and I have nothing but respect for this man. Um, I have a lot more to say about him, but these are just a few of his outspoken comments.

00;14;56;12 - 00;15;27;08

### UFOs Over Slovenia
UFOs over Slovenia. Now, I apologize in advance. I was not really able to find anything on this subject. Besides a 1970s crop circle sighting, in a village in Slovenia, or some Reddit posts from around summer of 2023 of some really grainy photographs of supposedly UAP. So I'm just going to skip this entry. I really don't know what to cover here, but maybe Slovenia is a UFO hotspot I don't know. 

00;15;27;09 - 00;15;57;18
Gerb
### Quimbaya Ancient Airplanes
The Quimbaya Ancient Airplanes. I'm just going to be straight up with you guys. I don't like this entry, but I will entertain it nonetheless. The Quimbaya artifacts are several dozen gold figurines found in Colombia, made by the Quimbaya culture. Dated to around 1000 C.E.. A few of these figurines, which depict birds, fish, bugs, all of this are shaped like an airplane.

00;15;57;20 - 00;16;27;03
Gerb
It is likely an owl or a bird, but these supposed depictions of airplanes are used by ancient astronaut theorists. I wouldn't be surprised of ancient aliens covered this, to say that some sort of extraterrestrial race that flew 747 jumbo jets was visiting this culture. That's all I'm going to say on this. I think these artifacts are just trinkets that are being misconstrued for something grand.

00;16;27;05 - 00;17;00;20
Unknown
### Mystery Airships
Mystery airships was a craze that occurred in 1896 to 1897, where thousands of reports occurred of people seen mysterious airships or airship style UAPs. Some reports claimed to see the crewmen of these airships describing them as human looking. At the time, it was popularly believed that these mysterious airships were the product of some inventor or genius who was not yet ready to show his invention to the world.

00;17;00;23 - 00;17;35;25
Gerb
Now, while there were no records of sustained or long range airship flights at this time, it is not impossible that these were just in fact, prototype airships from some inventor. 

In fact, there were several successful manufactured airships from before this period, including Solomon Andrews successful test flights of his Orion airship in 1863. But remember, the capabilities were extremely limited to what observers saw and claimed to see in the sky.

00;17;35;27 - 00;18;21;12
Gerb
But most of these sightings were explained away as hoaxes or misidentification of celestial phenomena. As you'd expect. So just because this craze occurred so long ago, it's difficult to find any recorded evidence of these airships. So whether this was some inventor or a series of hoaxes, I'm not quite sure, or whether this has some more esoteric explanation, such as the UFO phenomena expressing itself to what people would understand as technology at the time, as some sort of airship type things that evolved into saucer shaped craft and cigar shaped craft.

00;18;21;14 - 00;18;56;27
Gerb
I don't know. I'm leaning towards just a mixture of hoaxes and just the exploration of airship technology at the time by inventors. So that's where I'm at. 

### The Aurora Texas UFO Incident
The [[1897 Aurora Texas UFO incident]] is the first alleged UFO crash retrieval that I'm aware of. Okay, so our story takes place on April 17th, 1897, where, according to locals, a UFO crashed on a farm near Aurora, Texas bashing into a windmill.

00;18;56;29 - 00;19;33;29
Gerb
According to The Dallas Morning News, on April 19th, 1897, the craft was piloted by one sole inhabitant who was deceased with his remains badly disfigured. But the paper still says, quote, he was not an inhabitant of this world. According to the same article in the paper, the ship was too badly wrecked to form any conclusion on its construction or how it was powered, but it does say the craft was built of an unknown mixture of metal resembling aluminum and silver, and must have weighed several tons.

00;19;34;02 - 00;20;06;02
Unknown
The paper also goes on to say that the town was planning a burial for the pilot the following day, at noon. The wreckage was thrown into a nearby well, and the inhabitant of the craft was buried with a stone slab resembling what was seen of his craft. So is this story real or not? Well, I don't know. But in 1980, in a time magazine interview with Etna, Peggy is an 86 year old Aurora, Texas resident.

00;20;06;05 - 00;20;42;27
Unknown
She said that the story had been fabricated, trying to bring attention to the town's since a railroad bypassed it and the town was slowly dying. So let's take a look at the investigation done by Mouffe on the mutual UFO network, a nonprofit ran to investigate UFO sightings in 1973. Bill Cayce led an investigation into the Aurora, Texas crash in this movement uncovered two new eyewitnesses to the crash Mary Evans, who told how her parents would not let her visit the crash site.

00;20;42;27 - 00;21;04;18
Unknown
But the parents went to the site and discovered an alien body. And Charlie Stephens, who was ten at the time, who said he saw some sort of airship trailing smoke as it headed north towards Aurora. He wanted to investigate the crash, but his father made him finish chores. His father the next day went into town to see the wreckage.

00;21;04;20 - 00;21;28;22
Unknown
Move on, then investigated the Aurora Cemetery, where the supposed pilot was buried. They found a grave marker that appeared to show a flying saucer of some sort, as well as strange readings from their metal detector, because, according to some, some parts of the pilot ship were buried with the pilot. Move on. Asked to exhume the site, but the cemetery declined permission.

00;21;28;25 - 00;21;56;00
Unknown
After move on investigation, the marker mysteriously disappeared from the cemetery, and a three inch pipe was placed into the ground where MacFarlane's metal detector no longer picked up metal readings from the grave. It was thus presumed that maybe the metal was removed from the grave if there was some. There. Move on reported that their evidence was inconclusive, but they did not rule out the possibility of a hoax, so think what you will of this case.

00;21;56;00 - 00;22;27;07
Unknown
I'm not quite sure what to think, but it is interesting nonetheless. The 1561 celestial phenomenon over Nuremberg is one of the first examples of a mass UFO sighting in recorded history. In 1561, a broadsheet news article printed in the Holy Roman Empire described a mass sighting of celestial phenomena. Residents saw hundreds of globes, cylinders, rods and strange objects at sunrise.

00;22;27;09 - 00;22;52;21
Unknown
The objects flew across the sun, giving the appearance of a battle. Residents also claimed to see a black triangular object close to the ground, followed by a crash. Some of the other described shapes included crosses, small spheres, two large crescents, a black spire, and cylindrical objects emitting smaller spheres. So what do the skeptics like to say this is?

00;22;52;28 - 00;23;22;24
Unknown
Well, some think this is an example of Carl Jung's mass hysteria. One of the first collective examples of a collective consciousness forming a narrative. While others like to say, this is a sun dog. I don't think the sun dog explanation is likely, but this case is extremely perplexing nonetheless. Erich von Daniken is a figure we mentioned in our first episode of the iceberg with the Nazca Lines.

00;23;22;26 - 00;24;04;16
Unknown
Von Daniken is the author of chariots of the gods, a book that proposes the ancient astronaut hypothesis in which extraterrestrials made contact with early humans, influencing culture and settlement. Von Daniken proposes that structures such as the Pyramids of Giza, the Maui of Easter Island, and Stonehenge are products of extraterrestrial influence or extraterrestrial building techniques. He presumes that numerous pieces of ancient artwork and sculptures and so forth depict astronauts and their space vehicles, aka extraterrestrials, and their complex technology.

00;24;04;18 - 00;24;32;04
Unknown
Von Daniken likes to explain the origin of religions as ancient humans coming into contact with an alien race so far advanced. They seem divine. Some of von Daniken claims on the ancient astronaut hypothesis and religion, especially the Old Testament in the Bible, are pretty interesting. Von Daniken will talk about Ezekiel's visions of angels and how these angels were actually UFOs.

00;24;32;06 - 00;25;02;18
Unknown
If you know anything about what a biblically accurate angel looks like, you'll understand that this would not be a confusing comparison. He also claims that things like the destruction of Sodom by fire and brimstone are actually a nuclear explosion. While I don't love all of von Daniken claims, especially those regarding extraterrestrials building or teaching leverage techniques on how to build ancient monoliths and megaliths.

00;25;02;21 - 00;25;34;14
Unknown
I do like to think the phenomena has possibly been here for thousands of years, and thus it's not inconceivable to think that whatever this phenomenon is has had influence on ancient human culture and religion and development. The 2009 Norwegian spiral anomaly was a curious and perplexing spiral of blue light seen in the skies of northern Norway and Sweden for a period of ten minutes.

00;25;34;16 - 00;26;14;23
Unknown
This blue spiral looked like it was coming from behind a mountain, stopping in mid-air and spiraling outwards. Some UFO enthusiasts immediately began speculating that this was some sort of UFO or extraterrestrial sign. Although on the 10th of December 2009, the Russian Defense Ministry announced it had been testing Bulava missiles, ballistic missiles that had failed, and thus the third stage of missile separation resulted in fuel and exhaust coming out the sides of the missile, sending it into a spiral, resulting in this sort of spiral shape.

00;26;14;25 - 00;26;43;11
Unknown
I personally am happy with that explanation. I don't need anything else to explain this issue away, but who knows, maybe it was ETS. The Fermi Paradox is a question proposed by Italian American physicist Enrico Fermi in the summer of 1950. On one day on a lunch break, Fermi asked if the universe is so big. Where is everybody?

00;26;43;14 - 00;27;25;12
Unknown
The Fermi Paradox highlights the discrepancy between lack of conclusive evidence of an advanced extraterrestrial species and the high likelihood of their existence. I personally despise the Fermi paradox, especially people who fall back on studies in conclusive evidence. The search for extraterrestrial intelligence. It's baffling to me. Ceti is essentially looking at one conical section of an entire observable universe, said he uses radio signatures because they suppose that other civilizations might use radio signatures like we do, because radio signatures carry information over a long range when maybe an extraterrestrial species uses neutrino communication or something like that.

00;27;25;19 - 00;28;01;12
Unknown
So Ceti is basically using a magnet to find a needle in the ocean, but a new form of Ceti called Dyson Ceti essentially looks for technosignatures from an extraterrestrial species. These are imprints of a species using advanced technology. Think of a Dyson sphere, but it baffles me that in a universe that is 92 billion light years in diameter, people will fall back on saying that extraterrestrial civilizations don't exist or we haven't found them even though we've been looking.

00;28;01;14 - 00;28;29;03
Unknown
When we look through a tiny conical section of space and time, wherever we look, it's it's absolutely absurd to me. But for the sake of this entry, let's entertain a few ideas of the Fermi Paradox. One. The great filter. The Great Filter suggests that every advanced civilization goes through some sort of filtering process, where the civilization will either kill itself off and die, or traverse the cosmos.

00;28;29;05 - 00;29;00;10
Unknown
This could be something like harnessing the power of nuclear weapons, or being destroyed, or harnessing advanced AI. Two and this one is really fun to think of the Dark Forest theory. Essentially, it races hide their communication signatures due to the fact they are afraid of something bigger, more powerful, and more advanced from them. So essentially, there's pockets of fire, civilization in the dark forest that they don't want to telegraph their presence.

00;29;00;12 - 00;29;25;00
Unknown
Three most alien civilizations are aquatic, and thus we cannot detect bio or technosignatures from light years and light years away. Four we are early. This suggests that although we come from a generation to star, we as humans are one of the precursor civilizations to this universe, that we are one of the first civilizations, an advanced species to form.

00;29;25;00 - 00;29;50;08
Unknown
I think this is very unlikely, but fun to think about. And five we are late. This theory suggests that we live in a graveyard. Essentially, all advanced civilizations have died out for one reason or another, and we are the last. Maybe I'll make a video someday. Like top ten most Interesting Solutions to the Fermi Paradox. But for now, just know that I do not like the Fermi Paradox.

I think it's limited. I think it is ignorant. Let's move on. Speculative evolution is the process of utilizing current biological knowledge of life here on Earth to extrapolate, to speculate. Biology and evolution of extraterrestrial species. Speculative evolution is often considered hard science fiction, because it does incorporate real biology to try and determine what a species might look like on another planet.

Due to its atmosphere, thick terrestrial and solar conditions. This look at evolution is also sometimes used for educational purposes, to hypothesize what some signs of early life may have looked like on this planet. A really good book on this subject is All Tomorrows by Kim Coleman, which explores a hypothetical future path of human evolution set in the near future to about a billion years from now.

It's really interesting. Give it a read. The Anunnaki are an ancient race of gods worshiped by the Sumerians, Acadians, Assyrians and Babylonians. Now, why we're all here, and where you've heard of the Anunnaki are from Zacharias Kitchen's transcriptions of the ancient Sumerian tablets, where Sitchin claims that the Anunnaki are an ancient, advanced race of extraterrestrials from the undiscovered ninth planet in our solar system, Nibiru.

00;31;27;12 - 00;32;02;09
Unknown
Sorry, Pluto, but you are most certainly not a planet. But anyways, according to Sitchin, the Anunnaki came to Earth around half a million years ago to construct a base of operations in order to mine gold. The Anunnaki combined their DNA with that of Homo erectus to create a species of slave miners, now known as modern humans. The Anunnaki were then forced to flee Earth due to Antarctic glaciers melting, causing the Great Flood, which also destroyed their earth bound base.

00;32;02;12 - 00;32;33;07
Unknown
And if you remember from our first episode with David Eick in The reptilians, this man claims that the reptilians are in fact the Anunnaki. So what do I think of this? Zacharias Hitchens translations of the Sumerian texts are known to be inaccurate and false to a very high degree. I do not think this is true. When I was a young conspiracy kid, I loved thinking about the Anunnaki and Nibiru and a mysterious extra planet in our solar system.

00;32;33;07 - 00;32;58;00
Unknown
But I think this is absurd. Again, what we talked about, I don't think it's insane to think that some sort of civilization had an effect on ancient man, or even possibly tampered with our DNA. But I do not believe in the story of the Anunnaki needing to create humans to mine gold for them. The Galactic Federation is pretty self-explanatory.

00;32;58;02 - 00;33;29;13

Think of Star Wars. Think of a network of extraterrestrial species that communicate, trade, interact, possibly war, all under one global banner of some governing body. Now, what's interesting about a supposed galactic Federation in our Milky Way galaxy in 2020, former head of Israel's military space program, Haim is said in an interview said that humans weren't ready for contact with extraterrestrials.

00;33;29;16 - 00;33;57;08
Unknown
In this interview, he claimed there was a Galactic Federation of extraterrestrials, some of which already existed on Earth. There's also a supposed CIA agent, John Ramirez, who has made similar claims of a present Galactic Federation. I think it's quite plausible. We exist in a galaxy that has a present Galactic Federation. I don't know for sure. I don't know if anyone does.

00;33;57;11 - 00;34;31;06
Unknown
Maybe some people do, but I think it's quite possible, and I would be fascinated to understand how a galactic network of extraterrestrials trade and interact with one another. If there's a common language, if there's common practices and culture and society. It's fascinating to think about. Indigo children. I'm going to be straight up honest with you guys. I have no idea why this was included in the iceberg, especially the second layer of this iceberg.

00;34;31;08 - 00;34;59;14
Unknown
I guess Indigo children are weird little kids who possess special, unusual, and sometimes supernatural traits and abilities like telekinesis. This idea is based on a concept in the 70s by Nancy and Tap, who said she began to notice Indigo children around the late 1960s. Look, I have no idea how this is supposed to be related to UFOs or extraterrestrials.

00;34;59;16 - 00;35;32;08

My guess is maybe these are like hybrid children. I don't know. I'm not a fan of this entry. I think it's really stupid if I'm being honest, but got it covered anyways. Gary McKinnon is a Scottish hacker who in 2002 perpetrated the biggest military computer hack of all time. McKinnon hacked numerous systems in the US military to look for a UFO cover up and free energy suppression.

00;35;32;11 - 00;36;03;17
Unknown
During his hack, McKinnon was able to hack into 97 US military and NASA computers over a 13 month period between February oh one and March oh two, all while in the house of his girlfriend's aunt in London. The US Military Cyber Security Division at the time was plain stupid games and winning stupid prizes. Gary McKinnon was able to guess basic passwords such as password to hack into some terminals.

00;36;03;20 - 00;36;34;09
Unknown
Anyways, what did McKinnon say he found? Well, to start, McKinnon acted on a hunch. That one Donna Hare, who was a former NASA launch photographic specialist, said that in building eight of Johnson Space Center, there was a lab set aside specially for airbrushing out UFOs from high resolution satellite imagery. McKinnon found and was able to access machines from building eight, upon which he found folders titled raw and processed.

00;36;34;11 - 00;37;00;15
Unknown
In these folders, he would find images around the size of 250MB, which at the time would have taken a long time as his terminal was only able to download about one megabyte every five minutes. McKinnon began to find a single image in the raw folder. He found what appeared to be a blue and white planet with a black backdrop.

00;37;00;17 - 00;37;32;01
Unknown
Superimposed on to that was a tubular form that was metallic white and had domes around its central circumference and at its ends. The craft had no rivets or seams and looked futuristic, though of course, due to the low resolution a number of shades. McKinnon couldn't make out too much detail from the imagery at this same time is when he saw his cursor began to move click out, and he was thus caught.

00;37;32;03 - 00;37;59;13
Unknown
Now, besides this incident, which occurred at the end of this hack, McKinnon was also able to find some other extremely interesting things. He found a 300 military personnel ledger that was a secret program called the Solar Warden. This program was a US military secret battalion in space that was used by the US Navy network and space operations Command.

00;37;59;16 - 00;38;35;05
Unknown
The necessary. In this, McKinnon found the Pentagon files storing quote extraterrestrial officers and quote contact between fleets. Among these were two ship names the USS, not USS. The USS, with the third letter maybe standing for space LeMay and Helen Carter. McKinnon said that the extraterrestrials officer list was not a list of aliens, but a list of officers who do not work on Earth.

00;38;35;08 - 00;39;04;08
Unknown
They serve a fleet of spaceships that operate outside of this planet. There is no doubt that McKinnon believes he is telling the truth and I don't know. I think there could be some credibility to what he says, especially the photos where UAP are airbrushed out of high res satellite imagery. Chris Mellon has commented on similar things that 4K satellite footage of UAP exists, but are classified or tampered with.

Heaven's gate. Now, I can't do too much justice to Heaven's Gate because there are some pretty incredible documentaries on YouTube about this cult. So I will just give an official overview. Heaven's gate was a UFO cult started by Bonnie Nettles in 1974. The group believed that they could transform themselves into immortal extraterrestrial beings by rejecting their human nature, and they would ascend to Heaven, referred to as the next level or the next evolutionary level above human.

00;39;41;17 - 00;40;07;17
Unknown
In 1997 and the passing of the Halley Bopp comet, the group thought that a UFO trailing the comet was the only way to evacuate the Earth, and thus 39 members of the court decided to give themselves a game over screen. Yeah, so there's a lot more interesting things on Heaven's Gate. YouTuber Dan Tobias just did a really interesting video on this.

00;40;07;20 - 00;40;33;20

Cults aren't my specialty, so I don't want to dive in too much. But if you want to know more, that's a great video and I'd recommend checking it out. Interplanetary contamination is actually a crucial thing to consider when planning space travel. It is basically bringing microbial life, or an invasive species from one planet to a new planet where the life is foreign.

00;40;33;23 - 00;41;10;08
Unknown
There are two types of interplanetary contamination. Forward contamination is the transfer of life or other organisms from Earth to a foreign celestial body, and back contamination, which is the introduction of an extraterrestrial organism to Earth, which could have potentially dangerous consequences to all of humanity. If you have seen the film alien, a good example of bad contamination would be the crew of the Nostromo bringing the Xenomorph back to Earth after being contaminated by such a parasitic species.

00;41;10;10 - 00;41;36;04
Unknown
Fortunately, there's rigorous protocol for spacecraft returning to Earth and any samples that spacecraft may have collected over its time in the cosmos and on another celestial body, and to prevent forward contamination. All spacecraft are pretty sterilized before they're sent out into the upper atmosphere and beyond. Although in 2019, if you remember, there was an Indian spacecraft that crashed onto the moon.

00;41;36;07 - 00;42;01;24
Unknown
There was a sample of tardigrades in that spacecraft that some scientists now are worried that there is some sort of lineage of tardigrades that have been surviving on the moon for a while, but let's just hope there isn't some far dormant, terrible extraterrestrial parasite or virus that is lying dormant on a meteor headed to Earth. Let's just keep our fingers crossed.

My friends. Thank you so much for watching. I hope you found some entries you enjoyed, thought were mysterious, or thought were laughably dumb. This is part two of the iceberg of six parts. Expect part three and a new microphone, which I just got. I just didn't want to record with a new mic. That's much better halfway through the video, expect that next episode some smoother audio quality.

00;42;24;26 - 00;42;26;14

I'll catch you all later. Thank you.
