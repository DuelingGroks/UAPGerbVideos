# Reverse Engineering Programs Analysis  

## üìå Overview  
The study of [[Unidentified Aerial Phenomena]] (UAP) reverse engineering has long been associated with [[Black Budget Programs]], [[Military Bases]], and private aerospace contractors. Whistleblowers, declassified documents, and historical case studies suggest that multiple government-backed efforts have attempted to reverse-engineer non-human technology, operating under extreme secrecy.  

## üîç Key Allegations and Sources  

### **1. Whistleblower Testimonies**  
- **[[David Grusch]]** testified that legacy UAP retrieval and reverse engineering programs exist beyond congressional oversight.  
- **[[Bob Lazar]]** claimed to have worked at **[[S4 (Area 51 extension)]]** on extraterrestrial craft propulsion, particularly on gravity wave manipulation.  
- **Witness "Ed" ([[Dr. Steven Greer Files]])** described reverse-engineering work within the **[[412th Test Wing at Edwards AFB]]**, connected to the **[[Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR)]]**.  

### **2. Black Budget Programs & Military Bases**  
- **[[Lockheed Martin]]**: Suspected contractor for advanced aerospace projects, including rumored studies on recovered UAP materials.  
- **[[Battelle Memorial Institute]]**: Connected to **[[Wright-Patterson AFB Hangar 18]]**, reportedly involved in metallurgy research on anomalous materials.  
- **[[Wilson-Davis Memo]]**: Describes a 2002 meeting where Vice Admiral **[[Thomas Wilson]]** was denied access to a deeply classified UAP reverse engineering program.  

### **3. Notable Incidents & Programs**  
- **[[1947 Roswell Crash]]**: The first widely recognized claim of UAP retrieval and subsequent reverse engineering attempts.  
- **[[1953 Kingman, Arizona Crash]]**: Witnesses allege a recovered craft was sent to Nevada for study.  
- **[[1972 Edwards AFB Antigravity Research]]**: Documents reference anomalous propulsion experiments.  
- **[[Blackjack Program (DARPA)]]**: Some researchers speculate this satellite program may be tied to monitoring or reverse-engineering non-human technology.  

## üèõÔ∏è Conclusion  
The evidence for UAP reverse engineering programs is circumstantial but compelling. Whistleblower testimonies, leaked documents, and historical government projects all point toward a multi-decade effort to understand and replicate anomalous aerospace technology. Further investigation into **[[FOIA Requests]]**, **[[SAP (Special Access Program) Funding]]**, and **[[Contractor Involvement]]** may shed more light on these operations.
