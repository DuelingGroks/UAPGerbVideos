### üß† Connection to Dr. Eric H. Wang  
- **Dr. Eric H. Wang** was a **high-level scientific figure** associated with classified **Air Force reverse engineering programs**.  
- His title as **Chief of the Special Studies Office** suggests he had direct oversight of **retrieved foreign technology**, possibly including **non-human craft**.  
- Wang was **involved in Air Force technology studies** at **Wright-Patterson AFB**, linking him to **the infamous "Blue Room"**, where **crash retrieval materials were allegedly stored**.  
- **If Kingman was a true retrieval**, Wang would have played a key role in **studying, analyzing, and reverse engineering the craft**.

### üîé Additional Context & Speculation  
- **USAF Regulation 200-2 (1953)** was designed to **suppress UFO reports**, coinciding with the Kingman incident.  
- **Robert Salas & Robert Jacobs' testimonies** suggest that **UFOs had a clear interest in nuclear sites**, raising questions about why the Kingman crash occurred **so close to atomic tests**.  
- **Bill Uhouse**, a retired **USMC engineer**, later claimed to have worked on a **flight simulator** derived from **the Kingman crash retrieval**, possibly under **Dr. Wang's scientific oversight**.
