### 📌 Overview

Bill Uhouse was a former **U.S. Marine Corps fighter pilot** and **civilian test engineer** who claimed to have worked on **reverse-engineering alien technology**. His testimony is significant due to his **direct involvement with experimental flight simulators** and knowledge of the **1953 Kingman UFO Crash**.

### 🎤 Key Testimony Points

- **Military & Aviation Background:**
    - Served as a **fighter pilot** in **World War II and the Korean War**.
    - Worked as a **test engineer** at **[[Wright-Patterson AFB]]**, focusing on experimental aircraft.
    - **Marine Corps Service Verified**: According to [Richard Geldreich Jr.](https://medium.com/@richgel99/william-bill-g-uhouses-marine-corps-service-verified-53890a291fac), Uhouse’s military records confirm he was a Marine Corps fighter pilot in the **1950s**.
- **UFO Involvement:**
    - Approached by military personnel at **[[Wright-Patterson AFB]]** to work on classified programs.
    - Assigned to work on a **flying disc simulator** to train pilots for potential UFO-based technology.
    - Simulator was operational by **1958**.
- **[[1953 Kingman UFO Crash]]:**
    - Claims that a **30-meter flying disc** was **retrieved near Kingman, Arizona**.
    - The craft was **transported to [[Area 51]]** via a highly secretive military operation.
    - Allegedly, **four extraterrestrials** were recovered from the craft and taken to **Los Alamos for study**.

### 🚀 Reverse Engineering & Simulator Development

- **Technology Description:**
    - The craft was controlled using **six large capacitors** charged at **1 million volts each**.
    - It generated its own **gravitational field**, rendering seat belts unnecessary.
    - The controls required specialized **mind-body coordination training** due to perceptual distortions.
- **Interaction with Extraterrestrials:**
    - Mentions an **alien referred to as “J-Rod”**, who **assisted scientists** with engineering challenges.
    - J-Rod communicated both **verbally and telepathically**.
    - His knowledge was crucial in **understanding gravitational propulsion**.

### 🏛 Government Secrecy & Disclosure

- **Challenges of Secrecy:**
    - The craft's **exact design made modifications impossible**.
    - Classified under **Special Access Programs (SAPs)** with extreme compartmentalization.
    - Anticipated **public disclosure by 2003**, although official confirmation never occurred.
