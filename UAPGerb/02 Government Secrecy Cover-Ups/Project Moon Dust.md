### 📌 Overview

**Project Moon Dust** was a highly classified U.S. Air Force operation focused on **recovering and analyzing foreign or unidentified space objects**. Although officially it targeted **Soviet or foreign space debris**, multiple declassified documents and whistleblower testimonies suggest **Moon Dust also investigated UFO crash retrievals** and shared strong ties with **Wright-Patterson Air Force Base**.

Historically, Moon Dust was **kept off the public record**, often overshadowed by more visible UFO programs (e.g., **Project Sign**, **Project Grudge**, **Project Blue Book**). Nonetheless, **official memos, cables, and recovered debris** indicate its crucial role in collecting and studying unknown aerospace objects—both **terrestrial and potentially non-human**.

### 🗓 Timeline & Key Events

- **Early Mentions (1961)**
    
    - A U.S. Air Force draft policy (AFC 1E) proposes the **1127th Field Activities Group** assume collection responsibilities for unidentified flying objects.
    - **Project Moon Dust** is listed as an established program for **locating, recovering, and delivering** “descended foreign space vehicles.”
- **1960s–1970s**
    
    - Multiple **declassified State Department cables** confirm Moon Dust teams recovered suspected **Soviet satellites** and “space debris” in **Nepal**, **Pakistan**, and **Canada**.
    - Some documents reference **circular discs** or unusual materials lacking a clear terrestrial origin.
- **Connection to UFO Crash Retrievals**
    
    - In **internal memos**, eyewitnesses describe **cigar-shaped** or **disc-shaped objects**.
    - The consistent mention of **Wright-Patterson AFB** echoes other UFO crash retrieval cases (e.g., **Roswell**), feeding speculation that Moon Dust’s original scope was broader than just foreign human-made satellites.
- **Denial & Redactions (1980s–1990s)**
    
    - The Air Force publicly **denied** that Moon Dust had any role in UFO investigations.
    - **FOIA requests** revealed heavily **redacted files**, indicating continued classification.

### 🔍 Evidence & Claims

1. **Declassified Memos & Cables**
    
    - Multiple documents reference **“Project Moon Dust”** as an active recovery effort for **fallen space objects**, some described with **unconventional** characteristics.
2. **Diplomatic Cover**
    
    - Cables from **U.S. embassies** mention using diplomatic visits as a **“fishing expedition”** to gather data on crashed foreign objects (e.g., the Nepal incident in 1968).
3. **Wright-Patterson Link**
    
    - Nearly every official mention of Moon Dust includes **Wright-Patterson AFB** as the final destination for any retrieved debris—mirroring **other historical UFO crash retrieval accounts** (e.g., from **Roswell**).
4. **Official Denials**
    
    - In the 1990s, the USAF claimed **Moon Dust had been discontinued** and any UFO connection was purely coincidental. FOIA-obtained records often conflict with these statements.

### 🛡 Government Response & Secrecy

- **Air Force & Pentagon Statements**
    - Publicly maintained Moon Dust was purely for **“routine space object recovery”**—nothing to do with UFOs.
    - Highly **redacted** portions in official memos suggest sensitive details were compartmentalized.

- **Modern Whistleblowers**
    - **David Grusch** and other former intelligence officials have recently hinted at **legacy crash retrieval programs** with direct lineage to _earlier efforts_ like Moon Dust.
