## 📌 Overview

The **Atomic Energy Commission (AEC)** was a U.S. government agency established in 1946 to oversee nuclear energy development, weapon testing, and research. It played a key role in Cold War-era nuclear testing, including **Operation Upshot-Knothole (1953)**—a series of nuclear tests conducted in **Nevada** with major implications for military strategy, radiation studies, and potential UFO encounters.

## 🏛 The Atomic Energy Commission (AEC)

### 🔬 Purpose & Formation

- Established by the **Atomic Energy Act of 1946**, replacing the Manhattan Project’s military control.
    
- Managed **nuclear weapons development**, **civilian nuclear power**, and **scientific research**.
    
- Oversaw nuclear testing at **Nevada Test Site, Bikini Atoll, and Enewetak Atoll**.
    
- Worked closely with military branches and private contractors, such as **Los Alamos National Laboratory** and **Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory**.
    

### 🛸 AEC & UFO Connections

- The AEC’s involvement in nuclear programs drew **unexplained aerial phenomena (UAP) reports**.
    
- **[[Robert Salas]] & Robert Jacobs’ testimonies** suggest UFOs had an interest in nuclear sites.
    
- **AEC officials & scientists, including those at [[Wright-Patterson AFB]], may have analyzed retrieved materials from UFO crashes.**

## 🔥 Operation Upshot-Knothole (1953)

### 🎯 Objectives

- Conducted at the **Nevada Test Site** between **March 17 – June 4, 1953**.
    
- Consisted of **11 nuclear detonations** aimed at studying:
    
    - **Weapon yield efficiency**
        
    - **Effects on military vehicles & structures**
        
    - **Radiation impact on soldiers & the environment**
        

### 🚀 Key Tests

1. **Annie** (March 17) – First televised nuclear test.
    
2. **Nancy** (March 24) – Examined radiation effects.
    
3. **Ruth** (March 31) – Investigated nuclear blast pressures.
    
4. **Grable** (May 25) – Tested nuclear artillery shell delivery (Atomic Cannon).
    
5. **Climax** (June 4) – One of the largest tests in the operation.
    

### 🛸 UFO Connections & The Kingman Crash

- **[[Arthur Stansel (Fitz Werner)]]**, an **engineer on Upshot-Knothole**, later claimed he was involved in the **[[1953_Kingman_UFO_Crash|Kingman, Arizona UFO crash retrieval]]**.
    
- **Stansel’s testimony** describes a **30-ft saucer-shaped craft**, allegedly **retrieved near a test site and studied by military scientists**.
    
- **[[Dr. Eric H. Wang]]**, Chief of the **Special Studies Office**, had direct oversight of retrieved foreign (or non-human) technology.
