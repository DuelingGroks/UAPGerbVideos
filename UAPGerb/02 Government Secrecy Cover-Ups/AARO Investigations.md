### 📅 Establishment & Purpose

The **All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO)** was formally established in **July 2022** under the **Department of Defense (DOD)** to **investigate unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs)** across air, sea, space, and transmedium domains. AARO is the successor to prior government efforts such as the **UAP Task Force (2020–2022)** and earlier UFO investigative programs.

### 🛸 Objectives & Scope

- **Standardize UAP reporting across military and intelligence agencies**.
- **Analyze radar, sensor, and eyewitness data** to identify credible cases.
- **Assess national security threats linked to unknown aerial objects**.
- **Investigate historical UFO reports and classified special access programs (SAPs)**.
- **Collaborate with civilian scientific efforts** where applicable.

### 🔍 Key Reports & Findings

- **2022 & 2023 UAP Reports**: Confirmed **hundreds of new UAP sightings**, many remaining unexplained.
- **Whistleblower Testimonies**: Figures like **David Grusch** alleged that **AARO lacks full access to classified crash retrieval programs**.
- **AARO Public Statements**: The office has denied evidence of extraterrestrial technology but continues investigations into unexplained UAPs.
- **Senate Intelligence Committee Inquiries**: Ongoing efforts to increase transparency and expand AARO’s authority over classified programs.

### 🛠 Official Investigations & Responses

- **Pentagon & DOD Statements**: Ongoing analysis but no confirmation of non-human technology.
- **Congressional Oversight**: Lawmakers have pushed for more transparency and a secure reporting process for whistleblowers.
- **FOIA Requests & Public Interest**: Researchers continue to seek declassified reports on AARO’s findings.

### 🛸 Theories & Speculation

- **Legitimate Scientific Inquiry**: AARO is a genuine attempt to study UAPs with modern tools.
- **Controlled Disclosure**: Some argue AARO is a limited hangout meant to manage public perception.
- **Institutional Roadblocks**: Critics suggest the office is hindered by lack of access to deeper **Special Access Programs (SAPs)**.
